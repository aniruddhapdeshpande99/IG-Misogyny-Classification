when I come, I release what no longer serves. when I come, I reconnect to my sensual body. when I come, I make new neural pathways in my brain to heal my sexual trauma. when I come, I cleanse all my chakras. when I come, I make my pleasure a priority & advocate for my sexual wellness. when I come, I manifest my dreams. âž– have you had an orgasm today, y or n? (if no, get on it.)
