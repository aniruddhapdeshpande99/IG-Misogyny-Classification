2019 was the year I heard my heroes say “Your work inspires me”. the year I spoke on stage. the year I was photographed, filmed, & had my makeup done professionally. the year I traveled the most I ever have in my life (& finally got my passport). the year I saw myself in the pages of Rolling Stone, Broccoli Mag, Glamour, The New York Times. the year I was featured in Nylon, Esquire, Well+Good, Paper magazine. the year I collaborated with brands, people, & campaigns I believe in. the year I celebrated 8 years of starting my business as a sexuality doula & sex educator. the year a major publication asked me to write a book for them. the year folks recognized me on the street & told me my work changed their lives. the year I became financially independent from my husband. the year when people told me my work was important & I fully (finally) believed them. the year I stepped into my power & exceeded my own expectations.

today, I—a queer Black femme + a descendant of an enslaved West African woman given the name ‘Nancy Green’ (and many many others before her whose names were lost)—am standing in awe of all that I became & accomplished in 2019, by the grace of god & with help from my ancestors. I am so grateful.
