It‚Äôs not a hobby. It‚Äôs not a side project. I don‚Äôt do this for fun as a way to kill time. This is my livelihood, my life‚Äôs work.
So when I‚Äôm asked to do emotional labor for free (in the form of advice, education, & counseling); when I‚Äôm expected to speak openly about my trauma & healing journey on platforms with a wide reach without payment; when I‚Äôm approached by big-time production companies & publications to collab but they cannot offer me compensation for my time & labor, I get angry. These people see the things that I do on the internet & think that it‚Äôs appropriate for them to use me in this way, touting ‚Äúexposure‚Äù as an acceptable currency. They don‚Äôt seem to realize - or care - that ‚Äúexposure‚Äù is not a reliable source of income. They don‚Äôt seem to realize - or care - that what they are doing, is exploitation.
Of course I want my work to reach more eyes & ears. Of course I want the thrill of being able to be featured in magazines, television shows, & books by or alongside big names. But ‚Äúexposure‚Äù on its own does not (cannot) pay my bills. Exposure is an illusion of wealth, & I will not allow myself to be seduced by that illusion in exchange for my life‚Äôs work.
I put my entire heart & soul into everything that I do. So much thought & intention goes into everything I make, every person I hold space for, every class that I teach. I ask that you see me. I ask that you respect me. I ask that you value my time & the emotional, physical, & psychical labor I expend on behalf of this movement I am a part of, in which I choose to expose parts of me that are tender, raw, & risky for me to reveal.
Pay artists. Pay healers. Pay emotional laborers. If you really love & support our work, enough to want to feature it on your big platforms, show that love & support by compensating us for our labor. We are worth it.
