what doesn’t kill you makes you a bad bitch. swipe 👉🏾 for more of my joy (+ a cute dog pic)

I spoke on a panel yesterday about sex + pleasure, which was the first time I had shown up for my work in a while. on the drive over, I worried that I had lost it—‘it’ being my sexual liberation + healing mojo. I worried that I wouldn’t be able to show up fully with how much I have been distracted & thrown off my axis, especially for an event that was supposed to be about sex + pleasure (which, in full transparency, I’ve struggled to access over the last few weeks). but ... I surprised myself with how much poise & power I embodied, with how much I snapped back into my role as a leader and facilitator. it was a blessing to be reminded that my greatness and verve never left my body. it was a blessing to be reminded how much my work as a sexuality doula and educator fuels me, fills my cup, gives me joy and meaning, heals me. I’m infatuated with what I do and I do it well. I’m so excited to get back to work this week.

other things I’m excited about: I’m excited that Mercury is retrograding which will aid in the releasing I’ve been forced to do that I am now fully surrendering to. I’m excited to be in LA officially in my dream apartment which I manifested with my own juju (which has natural light that is so beautiful & perfect that it’s almost absurd). I’m excited to keep nesting and building my home with intention. I’m excited to really ground into self-care to help continue to stabilize me. I’m excited to still be receiving unwavering support & love from my friends, family, and ancestors. I’m excited about all the cool opportunities I’m being presented with and how much possibility is being created with my own magic. I’m excited to step more fully into Big Empress Energy™️. I am blessed & highly favored. ☀️
