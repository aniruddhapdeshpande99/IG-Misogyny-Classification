I woke up this morning feeling like a goddess. it feels great to have her back.
〰️
because it’s been a while since I’ve taken (or posted) a sensual selfie, I think it’s important to remind everyone why I do it.

I take sensual selfies to subvert the male gaze; to defy & reject respectability politics rooted in white supremacy & patriarchy; to take up space with & celebrate unapologetically my Black queer body.

I take (+ post) sensual selfies as an act of resistance in a culture (and on this platform in particular) where sex sells & at the same time, the empowerment of my sexuality, the demonstration of my sexual agency, & the ownership of my sexual narrative is seen as dangerous.

I take sensual selfies to get your attention & to underscore how deeply troubling it is that “female nipples” is more policed & regulated on social media platforms than hate speech & racist rhetoric.

I take sensual selfies to help teach other women/femmes to liberate their sexuality, shift their sexual self-image, & unpack their own internalized slut shame, body negativity, & whorephobia.

I take sensual selfies to remind you that my femme body, with clothes or without, is never an invitation to be sexualized or fucked unless I say so.

I take sensual selfies not to titillate you, but to honor & own myself. Because my body, my sexuality, my power is mine.

If you’re new here, now you know. :) #sensualselfiechallenge #sextingmyself #mybodyisnotanapology
