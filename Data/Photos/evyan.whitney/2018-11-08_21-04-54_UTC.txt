youâ€™ve given me twelve years of your life. twelve years of your unshakable devotion. 4,380 days of your unconditional love. thank you for loving me so fiercely. for fighting for my humanity. for allowing me to be soft. for advocating for my wellness. for giving me the love & companionship I deserve. thank you for having the willingness + capacity to grow with me as I grow, & for allowing me the space I need to continue to become my own person. thank you for choosing me over & over again as your wife, your partner, your best friend. with each year that passes, I am in awe of how our love & attraction for each other continues to grow & deepen. our relationshipâ€”the stability weâ€™ve built in each other, the tradition of strength + authenticity our love has been built on, the unfettered commitment we have to one anotherâ€”is one of my greatest accomplishments. I love you, @jonathanmead. happy anniversary. (12 fucking years!!!!!!!)
