“I signed two purity contracts when I was around nine and thirteen. It was co-signed by my dad, the notion being that he was the holder of my purity. I was making this agreement to the church, to God, and to my father that I was going to be pure by the time that I got married.

No one was talking about what consent was. It wasn’t until my ex-boyfriend and I broke up that I realized our entire sexual relationship wasn’t consensual, and there were actually many, many times where I was actually being coerced and assaulted by him. I had no idea, because the only education that I got about sex was, you know, you do it with someone you love. We said that we loved each other, and I assumed that’s all that you needed.

I respect my parents for wanting to keep me abstinent, and I know they were doing that as their way to keep me safe and protected. But I wish that there had been just a little more room for them to say: If you do have sex, here’s how to keep yourself safe, here’s where you need to go buy condoms, here are the things you need to be talking about when it comes to consent.”

Excerpts from my recent feature in @esquire (!!) where I talked about the sex ed I got and how it made me who I am today.

I had so much fun on this shoot and loved working with @christelle_studio. Thank you @mitchellkuga for giving me and other QTPOC us a platform where we could tell our stories and speak our truths. And thanks to the entire team over at @esquire who made this experience so magical.
