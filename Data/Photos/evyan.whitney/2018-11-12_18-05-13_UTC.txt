this year, I expanded. I took up space & I stopped hiding—behind my lack of experience, behind my insecurities, behind my fears. this year, & for the first time in my career, I put myself out there as a teacher, a speaker, a workshop facilitator. I taught eight in-person workshops & did four speaking gigs in Portland, New York, & Central California this year. I didn’t think I could do this, sincerely. I always thought that I was better as the person behind the screen, out of the spotlight. I always shied away from teaching because I didn’t feel like I knew enough, that I had enough talent, that I could really help people. my imposter syndrome has always kept me small & hidden. this year, I said “fuck it.” ➖ I am feeling immensely proud of myself after having taught my last workshop of 2018 on Saturday (where this photo was taken). every time I do it, it’s hard. it challenges me & makes me question myself. but I show up & do it anyway, because this is my life’s work & in my bones I know I was made for this. ➖ here’s to working hard on to manifest what you dream. here’s surprising yourself with your tenacity. here’s to feeling the fear & showing the fuck up anyway. heres to being your own muse. here’s to being your ancestor’s wildest dreams.
