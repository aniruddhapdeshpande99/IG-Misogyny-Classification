If you consider yourself a sexually liberated person; if you call yourself a feminist; if you believe in the sexual liberation of others; if youâ€™ve made it your job to instigate the sexual liberation of others through things like sex coaching, pole dancing, sensuality courses, boudoir photography, etc., and youâ€™re not using your voice and platform to speak up for and support sex workersâ€”you should be.
-
Some ways to do thatâ€”
â€¢ listen to sex workers
â€¢ support sex workers
â€¢ respect sex workers
(& Iâ€™ve created a ton of resources to help you do all of thatâ€”check out ep. 35 of my podcast, #thesexuallyliberatedwoman. You can find it right now on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Stitcher, + Spotify).
-
Sex worker rights are human rights, and we cannot be sexually free until all of us are sexually free.
-
Oh, and if by chance your feminism excludes sex workers; if it appropriates sex work while also declaring that sexual liberation doesnâ€™t involve having sex for money; if it slut shames & perpetuates the whorearchy; if it equates sex work with sex traffickingâ€”it is not feminism and it is not sexual liberation. It is whorephobic, misogynist, and ignorant, and you can miss me with all of it.
