I’ve got exciting news (watch til the end for a surprise) ... I’m moving back to LA! ✨✨✨ I’ve been calling Portland my “home” for almost 9 years, but it’s never really felt like my home-home. I’ve been missing Los Angeles terribly; it’s where my roots are, where a lot of my chosen family live, and each time I’ve gone back I’ve felt lighter and more able to access my radiance. Actually, it was this most recent time where I spent 16 days in LA when my mom told me, “Ev’Yan, every time you’re there you just seem to come alive.” And it’s true. I can’t deny the truth of how I feel anymore. It’s time for me to get the fuck out of this damp, dark place and to begin to rebirth myself.

Every tarot card reading I’ve gotten in the last two weeks has told me that it’s time to take a risk, that fortune favors me when I’m bold, and that so much joy and abundance awaits me when I choose to move forward toward my desires and pleasure (shout out to @thequietestrevolution !). So, I’m doing it.

Los Angeles, I’m coming for you! Excited to go on this new adventure and really ready to get the fuck out of white ass, oppressive ass, racist ass Portland. (thank you to my lover @jonathanmead for this capture ❤️)
