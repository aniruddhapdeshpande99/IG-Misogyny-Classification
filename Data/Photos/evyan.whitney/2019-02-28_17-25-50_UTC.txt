there’s a lot of talk in the body-posi movement about women + non-binary folks* embracing their body hair, which is great. but every time this conversation comes up, the bodies & hair that’s used as an example for this embracing are light-skinned and/or with straight & fine hairs.

so I wanna shout out the babes with the 4C pubes, with the thick & coarse bushes, with the razor bumps & ingrown lumps from strands that coil into themselves, & the body hair so dark & defiant that it refuses to be hidden or tamed.

your body & the journey to love & accept the hair that grows out of it is a radical act of body sovereignty. I see you.

*amended the language on this post to include nb + gnc folks, as it was brought to my attention that “womxn” & “femmes” excludes agender & trans people, which was not my intention but I recognize that my choice of words has an impact. my apologies.❤️
