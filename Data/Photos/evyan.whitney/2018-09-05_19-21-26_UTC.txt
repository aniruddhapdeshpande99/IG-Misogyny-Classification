the #sensualselfiechallenge started today & I am overjoyed + overwhelmed. the response to this challenge has surpassed my own expectations & it’s blowing my mind. literally. I am processing a lot right now—the fact that there’s over 2,500 of you signed up & how that number keeps rising as many of you are just joining today; the fact that when I originally created this challenge, I thought no one would join, that this would not resonate at all with anyone; the fact that the response to this, the desperate need for this, is beyond what my tiny brain can comprehend. I am also drowning in emails/DMs at the moment which is contributing to my overwhelm in many ways (more on that in a moment). mostly, I am feeling incredibly proud of this movement I’ve created & despite me feeling a bit depleted right now (I’ve been giving so much of myself & there’s a lot of energy being directed to me at the moment)—thank you for being here. thank you for taking up space. thank you for unhiding your radiance. you are inspiring me immensely & this is only day one.

btw! this sensual selfie is inspired by the radiant @galadarling who led us into day one of the challenge with her self-loving magic & fierceness. thank you, babe, for shining your light & reminding us we deserve to shine too.
