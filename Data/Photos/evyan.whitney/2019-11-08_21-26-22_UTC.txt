On November 8th in 2006, I went on a date with a hot guy I found doing a random search on Myspace. I went into the date with every intention of him being my fuck-buddy and ended up walking away from it feeling stupidly in love with him. 13 years later, he still has the ability to make my eyes blurry and my body melt.

Jonathanâ€”I am proud that weâ€™ve created a relationship with each other where we each feel as loved in our union as we do free. You are my best friend, my confidant, and the dick is so bomb. Thank you for choosing me each day and for loving me so fiercely as you do. I love you deeply. Happy anniversary ðŸ§¡ðŸ§¡ðŸ§¡
