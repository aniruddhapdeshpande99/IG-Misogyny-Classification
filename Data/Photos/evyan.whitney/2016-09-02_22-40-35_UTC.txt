#howibleed / volatile. darkness. beauty. quiet rage.
this has been a weird bleed for me. this one has been hard. my emotions have felt really dark & deep, & my body is manifesting this in tangible, visceral ways. I hardly ever leak, but this cycle I've watched twice as bright red streaks have run down my legs, leaving a trail on the hardwood floors to the bathroom, staining my sheets & my ragged underwear, reminding me of how alive & powerful my body is, how sometimes I cannot control it.
I've been crying in my sleep a lot this week, which speaks to emotions being released that I in my waking life cannot process or face. I've been really mad, too; like, inwardly seething at all the injustice that is happening in this world. I don't vocalize this rage because it's impolite or too honest. but my body does, unapologetically, through its blood. & thank god for that because as it sheds itself, I release toxicity. I release doubt. I release depths of rage my human body cannot fathom. I become new.
these are the parts of being a woman we've been taught to hide, that we've been encouraged to not show. but I am not ashamed of my body. matter of fact, you should be thanking me, for I am not just processing & releasing my shit. I am processing & releasing yours too.
