I am queer enough, even if I donâ€™t go to any Pride events this year.

I am queer enough, even if Iâ€™m not currently in a queer relationship.

I am queer enough, even though I came out later in life.

I am queer enough, even if Iâ€™m still trying to figure out my queer identity.

I am queer enough, even if my imposter syndrome says otherwise.

I am queer enough, even if Iâ€™m married to a man.
And I am black enough even if the man Iâ€™m with is not.
