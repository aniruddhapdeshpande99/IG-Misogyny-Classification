10 years ago today, @jonathanmead and I went on what would be our first date and we were inseparable ever since. Eight days later, we said "I love you." Six months later, we moved in together. One year later, we got married. We chose not to let logic rule our union and instead relied on intuition, on the way our bodies felt when they were near each other. That became our truth, the only gospel we adhered to. It was a wild ride and it went totally against what we both understood about relationships at the time. But we found our footing in and with each other. Ours was a path made by walking. When you know, you know. And we knew instantly.
It would take me 10 years to list all of the beautiful things I've been given by way of this relationship. It would take me 10 more to describe with adequate, eloquent words how much I love this man, how much I feel for him, how much I adore and cherish him, how he makes me laugh, how he gives me such pleasure, how he's given me precious, precious space to be the truest expression of myself that I can be. I wish I could tell him but I'm convinced it's not humanly possible. My love for him cannot be told in words, only in gestures with my body. This is a language he is almost fluent in, a language written by our history, a language only we understand. And when we speak it, it's beautiful. So beautiful.
Jonathan, our relationship is my greatest accomplishment. Our love is my personal legacy. I am so privileged to have you as my life partner. I am so honored to be chosen daily by you. Thank you for loving me so deeply. Thank you for encouraging me to blossom into the woman I am today, and thank you for accepting me unconditionally in that blossoming. Your love for me has healed me.
10 years. 10 motherfucking years! And you still make my mouth water. I love you and think you're dreamy.
