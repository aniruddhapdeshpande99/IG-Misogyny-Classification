What kind of sex do you want to have? How do you want to be kissed? How do you want to be touched? What parts of your body ache to be touched/stimulated when you're turned on? How do you want those parts of your body to be touched? And with what firmness?

How do you want your partner to come on to you? In what ways would it feel safest/pleasurable for them to let you know they're interested? How would do you want to communicate your own desires to your partner? What would you do with your body? Your eyes? What would you ask for audibly?

What kind of pacing do you want to experience during sex? And if that pace needed to change—either to be faster or slow—what would you say to convey that? How much foreplay do you want? What kind of acts would you want to explore within foreplay?

If you want to be penetrated, how would you know when your body is ready for penetration? What messages would your body give you? And what messages would you give your partner?

How do you want to feel during sex? What do you want to be happening in your head? In your body? How do you want to be treated after the sex is over? How do you want to be held, spoken to, taken care of (if at all)?
➖
Use these questions as prompts to help you get clear about what you want during sex. (And if you’re coming up dry about what you do like, try flipping it and exploring what you DON’T like.) By answering these questions, you are centering your pleasure and putting your sexual needs first—which is a radical act.

Another tip: During your next masturbation session, make note of how you get your own self off. Notice the way you touch yourself, notice the speed, firmness, and location of those touches. The way you touch yourself when you’re by yourself can tell you a lot about how you’d like to be touched when you’re with someone else.
