my name is Ev'Yan (pronounced Ev-Yahn—two words said fast). I’m a s-xuality doula (which, if you want to know what that is/means, check out episode 37 of my podcast @sexuallyliberatedwoman), a s-x educator, & a facilitator for womxn’s sexual + sensual liberation. I teach workshops & courses, give talks, & do one-on-one sessions with womxn who want to step out of shame & into their sexual power. I am a Virgo with a moon in Cancer and my rising in Sagittarius.

I’ve been called an “influencer” which is not totally correct. while I recognize that I do have some influence, I don’t identify as an influencer in the way our culture uses that word. I am a teacher, a speaker, & a businesswoman—not necessarily in that order. the work that I do is my deepest passion; it is also my full-time job. I have deep reverence for what I do & demand that my time, energy, expertise, & emotional labor is respected & that I am compensated for all of those things.

this month, I am quietly celebrating an anniversary. I have done this work in an official capacity for 8 years (though unofficially I’ve been doing it for a decade). this is a really a really big deal because I literally started from nothing. everything you see here is a product of my hard work & tenacity. none of this happened overnight & it means the world to me that after so many years, I am finally getting the recognition & shine I deserve.

I am the fruits of my labor. I am the boss of my business. I am Black history in the making.✨
