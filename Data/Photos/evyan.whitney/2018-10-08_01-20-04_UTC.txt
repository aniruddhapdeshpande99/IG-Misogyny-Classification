ladies & gentlefemmes—inspired by this royal asshat who left a comment on one of my videos about how my sexual liberation is not for male consumption, let’s have some fun!
tell me: if there were no “duded” what kind of life would you live? how would you feel? what would you “were”? would you “were” sweat pants? or would you “were” hoodies?
leave a comment with what you would do without “duded” in your life to exert your sexual tension on.
