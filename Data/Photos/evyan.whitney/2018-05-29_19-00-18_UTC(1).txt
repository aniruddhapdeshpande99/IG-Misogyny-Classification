originally, I wanted to caption this with “bitch don’t I look like a pharaoh?” (because, hello?) & leave it at that. but because I am a woman & because I have this particular body that is constantly being policed, a photo like this—where I am taking up space with my body regally, where I am celebrating my sensuality—is (begrudgingly) a political statement.
i’ve known that Instagram hates women for a while now, what with their censorship of women’s bodies (& bodily functions), nipples, & their sexuality. i’ve experienced this hatred personally (many of my non-explicit photos of my body have been removed for being “pornographic” & “unsafe”) & also as an empathetic witness—several of my women/femme friends + colleagues have been banned from this platform for life because of posting things mentioned above. this hatred & aversion of women is common knowledge at this point. but it’s recently gone to other more dangerous levels.
did you know that Instagram is currently (like, as we speak) blocking hashtags like #woman #femalestripper & any tags having to do with SW rights? I’m also getting reports that #boobs & #bra are being blocked for some people, too. this is all thanks to that fosta/sesta bill that was passed recently. & this is more than just sex-negativity. this is misogyny. this is censorship. this is violence.
if you believe in the bodily autonomy + the sexual agency & liberation of ALL people—including SWs—please please please use your platform to speak up about this. especially if you do work in this realm of sexual liberation—that includes you tantric teachers & healers, sex + relationship coaches, yoni egg peddlers, & people who do “pole fitness”. if you’re not angry, you should be.
& fuck you Instagram for making me have to talk about your fucking woman-hating nonsense when all I wanted to do was post this bomb photo of me looking like a goddamn magical Empress incarnate. & fuck you doubly for making me censor out my perfect nipples which takes away from the beauty of this photo. may you feel the heat of my wrath & utter discontentment until you do better.
