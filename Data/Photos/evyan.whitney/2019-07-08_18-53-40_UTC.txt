Mercury is retrograde and faking your orgasms instead of actually telling your partner what you need to get off is a bad habit that needs to be released this cycle.
.
When you fake your orgasms, you’re communicating to yourself that your pleasure and enjoyment isn’t important to you. When you fake your orgasms, you’re exacerbating tired, old tropes of sexual enjoyment that are founded in the performance of sex for the pleasure of someone else. When you fake your orgasms, you’re just reinforcing bad behavior (as @sweaterpupz says) and sexual incompetence.
.
Stop doing it, babe. I know that faking it feels easier than it is to tell the truth of why you’re not coming in the first place (i’ve been there too), but you’re only stunting your sexual growth. Set yourself free and use all that energy you’re wasting faking it to ask for the pleasure you want/deserve (and if you don’t know what you want, start exploring and being curious). Also, commit to getting to the bottom of WHY you’re faking it in the first place. Is it because you want the sex to end? Because you don’t want to hurt your partner’s feelings? Because you’re too nervous to ask for what you really want? I know it’s scary, but I promise you it's much more productive to face it head on than it is to continue to live in a lie.

Here are some prompts to help you re-evaluate and release this bad habit during this Mercury retrograde:
.
- When I think back to the last three times I faked my orgasm, why did I do it? What was happening in my mind/body at the time?
.
- What pressure am I putting on myself to perform during sex, and how might that be getting in the way of my orgasm?
.
- What shame do I feel about not being able to orgasm “properly”?
.
- What old stories about my orgasm, pleasure, and sex need to be shifted to help me stop faking? (i.e., “It’s hard to get me off”, “My orgasm is complicated”, “Orgasms are the entire point of sex”.)
.
- What do I need to communicate to my partner so that I can finally get the pleasure/enjoyment that I want?

May these following days of Mercury retrograde open your mind, lighten your load, and shake loose whatever needs to be shed so you can thrive and shine. ✨
