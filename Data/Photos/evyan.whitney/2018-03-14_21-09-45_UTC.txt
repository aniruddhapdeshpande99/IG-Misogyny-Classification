I have kept my sexuality hidden as a way to keep myself safe from harm or unwanted attention.
I have kept myself small to appease the feelings & comfort of others, to keep them from thinking unpleasant thoughts about me.
I have covered my skin to keep men’s eyes from straying, to keep men’s minds from wandering.
all my life, it has been second nature for me to shrink myself, to take up as little space as possible with my energy, my body, my desires. & now—I am learning to be big, to desire wide, to use the visibility of my body & skin as a political, radical, self-loving act.
I have finally found a home in my body, a home I feel safe in.
I choose to never leave myself.
