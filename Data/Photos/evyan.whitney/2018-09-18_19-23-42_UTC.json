Everything you say I keep thinking to myself 'OH MY GODDESS, IS SHE READING MY MIND?!' You are an amazing beautiful STRONG (better yet SEXUALLY strong) woman! I am a bisexual woman married, almost 10 years now, to a man who I truly believe is my twin flame. I love this man dearly and can't help to put him on a pedestal and bow down to him, which, trust me when I say he truly does deserves to have the ground he walks on to be kissed! But, like every relationship, there's been some...hearts broken, trust broken and faith in us lost. There's a lot of repair needed to be done to our foundation. In the last 6 years we have turned the heat up on our kink thermometer full blast, I'm talking like blazing full blast. Which included me mustering up the courage to reveal my darkest fantasies, for example I like to be choked. I didn't even consider such a thing until I stumbled across an erotic photo of a man choking a woman while giving her a very sexy kiss full of tongue. The picture screams out \"you're mine\" in such a way that made my stomach do a million flips, and that's how I found out about my \"being vulnerable\" fetish. So I spilled the beans and told him every fantasy I ever fantasized about but I'm still having a hard time getting him to explore outside of the school girl costume because he has to have other fantasies right? But I can't get him to tell me, I would hope after 13 years together he wouldn't be too shy or embarrassed but that is the vibe I'm getting. In the meantime I am starting to fantasize more and more about sex with women. And my lust for the feeling of a woman's body in my hands keeps getting stronger and stronger. I feel as if I should tell him because we both agreed being %100 honest with each other but I don't know how to A. Tell him & B. Fulfil this STRONG urge. I've subscribed to your emails and I will be following you on Your social media accounts. Hopefully you can give me that \"Ah ha!\" moment that answers my questions and curiosities. I am so glad I have found you! I can't wait to soak up some of your wisdom!\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc9c",

It\u2019s oppressive.\n-\nI think about this a lot because it comes up constantly in my sessions with clients. But I\u2019ve been thinking about it even more these days because of a recent conversation I had on my podcast, The Sexually Liberated Woman, with Amy of @wildflowersex where we go in (and throw massive shade) about sex educators and teachers who tout sex-positivity and sexual liberation while giving ridiculous (and rather sex-negative) rules and restrictions about what it means and looks like to be sexually liberated.\n-\nBut true sexual liberation doesn\u2019t come with rules or pleasure hierarchies. True sexual liberation is about giving yourself (& others) permission to be who you are and who you want to be sexually outside of our culture\u2019s (or a particular person\u2019s) shoulds. It\u2019s about fully honoring who you are as a sexual person\u2014your needs, your desires, your preferences, your body\u2014without apology or explanation.\n-\nThere is not one definition or expression of sexual liberation. And if anyone tells you otherwise, especially if they\u2019re a sex educator or they say they\u2019re sex-positive, run.\n-\nI\u2019m curious\u2014what \u201cshoulds\u201d have you or others put on yourself when it comes to your sexuality & sexual expression? And how have those shoulds held you back from feeling the freedom in sex that you so desire to feel?\nI\u2019m all ears. \ud83d\udc96\n-\nPS\u2014my podcast is called The Sexually Liberated Woman & you can find it on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, & SoundCloud. the episode with Amy is episode 33, link in bio."

Everything you say I keep thinking to myself 'OH MY GODDESS, IS SHE READING MY MIND?!' You are an amazing beautiful STRONG (better yet SEXUALLY strong) woman! I am a bisexual woman married, almost 10 years now, to a man who I truly believe is my twin flame. I love this man dearly and can't help to put him on a pedestal and bow down to him, which, trust me when I say he truly does deserves to have the ground he walks on to be kissed! But, like every relationship, there's been some...hearts broken, trust broken and faith in us lost. There's a lot of repair needed to be done to our foundation. In the last 6 years we have turned the heat up on our kink thermometer full blast, I'm talking like blazing full blast. Which included me mustering up the courage to reveal my darkest fantasies, for example I like to be choked. I didn't even consider such a thing until I stumbled across an erotic photo of a man choking a woman while giving her a very sexy kiss full of tongue. The picture screams out \"you're mine\" in such a way that made my stomach do a million flips, and that's how I found out about my \"being vulnerable\" fetish. So I spilled the beans and told him every fantasy I ever fantasized about but I'm still having a hard time getting him to explore outside of the school girl costume because he has to have other fantasies right? But I can't get him to tell me, I would hope after 13 years together he wouldn't be too shy or embarrassed but that is the vibe I'm getting. In the meantime I am starting to fantasize more and more about sex with women. And my lust for the feeling of a woman's body in my hands keeps getting stronger and stronger. I feel as if I should tell him because we both agreed being %100 honest with each other but I don't know how to A. Tell him & B. Fulfil this STRONG urge. I've subscribed to your emails and I will be following you on Your social media accounts. Hopefully you can give me that \"Ah ha!\" moment that answers my questions and curiosities. I am so glad I have found you! I can't wait to soak up some of your wisdom!\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc9c",
