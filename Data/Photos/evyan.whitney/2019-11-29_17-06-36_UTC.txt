SALE HAS ENDED! - I am at peace with my sexuality. My sexuality and sensuality are mine and no one else’s—not just because they are mine to claim but because I have put in years of work, healing, and liberation to be able to claim them as mine. I am proud of my sexuality and how I’ve cultivated a sense of autonomy + power within its expression.

And if you’re reading this, I want the same for you.

Starting today, all of my sexual liberation + healing courses and guides are 40% off. Here’s what they entail—

Sexual Liberation 101 simple and gentle class to help you start your own personal sexual revolution—with self-inquiry, inner reflection, and powerful questions to help you find sexual empowerment on your own terms.

30 Days of Sensuality will reconnect you to your body and help you reclaim your sensuality with playful sensual practices, audio meditations, and journaling prompts—one day at a time (I’ll be guiding you the entire way).
.
The Sexting Myself guidebook has everything you'll need to create a fun and liberating sensual selfie practice, one where you can affirm your sexual radiance with your own eyes. Includes poses and props you can use to enhance your selfies, affirmations to say to yourself as you practice, and a playlist to listen to as you play.

If you want to bring some liberation and healing to your sexuality before 2019 ends, this is for you.

The best part: 20% of all profits from this sale will go to @transformative_massage, a wellness center that that provides bodywork and self-care education to QTIPOC.
