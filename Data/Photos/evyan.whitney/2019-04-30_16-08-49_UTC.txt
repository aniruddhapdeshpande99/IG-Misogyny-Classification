I wish I had heard this before I signed my first purity contract at age 8 (co-signed by my father) which drilled in my head the notion that all of my worth lied within my ability to cut myself off from and make an adversary of my sensual body, and made it so that I felt my sexuality didn’t belong to me but was a prized possession of the men in my life. If I had heard this, I would’ve treated my sexuality (and the curiosity I had about it) as my own prized possession, one to be protected simply because it was mine.

I wish I had heard this when I was 14 and giving my sexual power away to boys who didn’t value or respect me, boys that just wanted a body with which to impose their sexual desires and fetishes onto. If I had heard this, I would’ve felt more empowered to say no to sexual situations I didn’t really want to be in but somehow fell into the flow of in order to be liked and feel wanted.

I wish I had heard this when I was 22, after years spent not listening to my sexual body because I had been conditioned for two decades not to feed into temptation, after years spent shaming myself after almost one decade of carrying guilt from having frequently given in to that temptation, and while in the midst of one of my many crises about how sex was not coming easily for me despite the fact that I was in a healthy, loving relationship with a man who honored and respected my body and sexuality. If I had heard this, I never would’ve thought there was something wrong with me, and I would’ve been more curious about reclaiming my sexuality as mine, on my own terms.

But no one ever said this to me then.
So I affirm this to myself now.
