Oppression is in the algorithm. It creates rules that say my body cannot be celebrated outside of the male gaze. It says that I’m not allowed to show my nipples because they’ve been categorized as “female”. It teaches me that my body is inherently pornographic and automatically sexualized—even when it’s just being a body. It teaches me that my body and my work are only allowed to exist if it’s to be consumed for and by the pleasures of men. It communicates that male sexuality, their bodies, and the way they celebrate them are the default and priority. It’s racist, sexist, transphobic, whorephobic, fatphobic, and white supremacist. It puts us—SWers, sexuality educators, fat, trans, black, brown, femme, non-binary people—at risk. It silences our voices, censors our art, invalidates our cashflow, and shadowbans our wisdom. It polices our existence and the space we take up. It tells us we are dangerous.

We need to talk about this more.

Next month, I’m going to be speaking on a panel at @welcomehome.studio with @thefatsextherapist, @ashleighchubbybunny, @dirtylola, and @ladysavaj to discuss the censorship and phobias happening in the modern sex-ed digital space.

The conversation will be moderated by @blkgirlmanifest and will be available online.

We need to shed light on the ways algorithm harms community and exacerbates white supremacist patriarchal capitalism. We need to be outraged and we need to use our anger to help challenge and shift these systems of oppression. We need to talk about this more.
