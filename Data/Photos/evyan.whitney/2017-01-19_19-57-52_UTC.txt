first selfie of 2017 / I've been in a weird place with Instagram. I've been shy to show my face or my life. I can't figure out if it's because I've been very protective of it or if it's because I don't feel comfortable taking up a lot of space here. I think it's a mix of both. I know that many of you are following me because of my sexy selfies & that's definitely adding to the weirdness. I feel this pressure to be "that girl" for you all the time, to only post things relevant to brazen sexuality. actually, a few months ago someone said to me after I told them about how long it had been since I had an orgasm that they were really shocked because based on what they see on Instagram, they assumed that I was having sex all day everyday. that's stuck with me. it's paralyzed me. it's made me hyper aware of the fact that my perceived online persona - one i've gotten a little famous for - doesn't always match up with my IRL persona. I've been thinking about that A LOT.
I hate to break it to you guys but my life isn't one big orgy. it's pretty mundane & boring most of the time. most days, my world is quiet & uneventful, & especially lately I've been processing a lot. I can't promise that I'll be posting a lot of sexy selfies here this year, so if that's what you're sticking around for you might want to unfollow me now. but I can promise that I'll be my authentic self & that I'll post things that are only in service of that expression - sexy selfies or not.
I don't even know if I'm making any sense, but I really needed to get that off of my chest. thank you for seeing me. ðŸ’˜
