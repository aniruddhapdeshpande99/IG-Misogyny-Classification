I’ll be honest: mercury retrograde has been rough for me. I’ve been processing a lot, questioning a lot, releasing a lot, feeling a lot. it’s all been good and necessary but very overwhelming, and I’ve been finding that it’s been easier for me to be in a funk of self-doubt that comes with navigating the unknown than it has been for me to be present to what is here now. and the one thing that never fails to bring me back to the present is gratitude. so. here’s a short list of what I’m grateful for in this moment:

I’m grateful for black femmes. I’m grateful for my ancestors. I’m grateful for sunny skies and cool water. I’m grateful for a partner who is willing to grow with and be challenged by me. I’m grateful for mangoes. I’m grateful for being a virgo. I’m grateful for my ability to know what I’m worth. I’m grateful for gold. I’m grateful for my blackness. & I’m grateful for all of you who are witnessing me in this moment. (thank you.) tell me what you’re grateful for today. ✨ (shoutout to @lexijohnnyhair for giving me a new look today. I am in love!)
