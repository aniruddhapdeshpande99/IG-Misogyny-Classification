a brief snippet from the collective sensual dance meditation I led this afternoon. so grateful for everyone who showed up to dance it out, as well as this platform for enabling me to connect with all of you + myself. if you missed it, both lives (the session + the Q&A and aftercare prompts) are currently in my stories for the next 24 hours. I also have a link to the list of songs I played during our time together in my bio.

if you were on the live with me, tell me how youâ€™re feeling in your body & what you think this practice made space for.

I got a lot of requests to do this again. soâ€”see you next Friday, same time? ðŸ§¡ðŸ§¡ðŸ§¡
