If sexual liberation comes with a “should”—you should have sex multiple times a day/week/month; you should orgasm every time you have sex; you should only be able to bring yourself to orgasm without a vibrator; you should squirt; you should masturbate; your sex should only be “sacred”; you should be submissive; you should have a small number of sex partners; you should be able to get wet without the use of lube; you should have one sexual partner at a time; you should only watch “feminist” porn; you should do tantra; you should be kinky; you should be non-monogamous; you should like a specific sex act that everyone else seems to like; you should be multiorgasmic—it isn’t sexual liberation. It’s oppressive.

I think about this a lot because it comes up constantly in my sessions with clients. But I’ve been thinking about it even more these days because of a recent conversation I had on my podcast, The Sexually Liberated Woman, with Amy of @wildflowersex where we go in (and throw massive shade) about sex educators and teachers who tout sex-positivity and sexual liberation while giving ridiculous (and rather sex-negative) rules and restrictions about what it means and looks like to be sexually liberated.
-
But true sexual liberation doesn’t come with rules or pleasure hierarchies. True sexual liberation is about giving yourself (& others) permission to be who you are and who you want to be sexually outside of our culture’s (or a particular person’s) shoulds. It’s about fully honoring who you are as a sexual person—your needs, your desires, your preferences, your body—without apology or explanation.

There is not one definition or expression of sexual liberation. And if anyone tells you otherwise, especially if they’re a sex educator or they say they’re sex-positive, run.
-
I’m curious—what “shoulds” have you or others put on yourself when it comes to your sexuality & sexual expression? And how have those shoulds held you back from feeling the freedom in sex that you so desire to feel?
I’m all ears. 💖
