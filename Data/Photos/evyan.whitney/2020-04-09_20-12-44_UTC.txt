when I see these photos, I'm brought back to the tenderness, sensuality, intimacy, + soft consensual sexuality that was shared during my shoot with @lewandmassager in partnership with @radimo.la. this scene with @j.luhv (and then later with @earthtojordi and @torrisees) was special for me in many reasons, but particularly because it was the first time in a long time that I'd been surrounded by Black folks in this way. the intimacy of getting my hair braided by Justice while Torri massaged my legs with shea butter while I locked eyes with Jordianaâ€”I will never forget how seen and held and sensual and affirmed and cared for I felt.

this shoot with @radimo.la set the standard for the ways I want the rest of my shoots to go. it was on this shoot that I felt affirmed in my gender expression, that I was held with softness by my community (I did this shoot a few days after my moving truck tragedy and less that 12 hours after landing in LA), that I was given space to be taken care of. alsoâ€”I developed so many crushes on set because everyone was so hot and sweet and beautiful and kind (the demisexual in me didnâ€™t know what to do with herself). big big love + gratitude to @radimo.la, @lewandmassager, and all the babes I was privileged to share space with; thank you for loving up on me, giving me care, and reminding me of the pleasure/community/support that I am worth. 
ps: goddamn I miss physical touch ðŸ˜«
