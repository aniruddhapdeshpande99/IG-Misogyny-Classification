The idea that openly celebrating your sexuality as a woman isn’t a sin. The idea that being unapologetically proud of your sexual body shouldn’t be a crime. The idea that your sexual radiance doesn’t have to be kept hidden. The practice of subverting respectability politics by choosing to take up space with your sexuality. The belief that you can be immodest (also known as: unladylike, immoral, slutty) and you still deserve respect—this is the ethos behind my work and I have this in my bio to remind those who come across my profile that even with having public photos of my nudish body, I am worthy of & will demand respect.

This quote is a riff off of something @alyraisman said after she received incredible amounts of backlash for posing topless for Sports Illustrated in 2017: "I did [it] because I love my body. I can express myself in any way that I want … But that doesn’t give anyone the right to judge me. ... It really made me realize that women do not have to be modest in order to be respected.” Her words, when I read them, made something click inside of me and I’ve been challenging society’s respectability politics and my own internalized slut shame ever since.

Womxn + femmes have been told in many different ways by the patriarchy to shrink themselves, to hide themselves, to not take up too much space—and these lessons are inherently teaching them (us) to be ashamed, to stifle, censor, and conform ourselves to fit in boxes that oppress us, dull our shine, null our radiance.

Fuck that shit. I personally will continue to be big with my sexual expression and loud with my soft + sensual energy as an act of resistance against these systems of oppression and I will inspire others to defy (or think about defying) societal pressures to be tame.

I do not have to be modest, I don’t have to be quiet, I don’t have to keep my sexuality hidden in order to be respected.
