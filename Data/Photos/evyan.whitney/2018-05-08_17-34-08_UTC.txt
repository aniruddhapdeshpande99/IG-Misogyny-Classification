my pleasure tools of choice (l-r: @chakrubs, @getmaude, @wevibe)
-
amethyst @chakrubs. rose quartz is & always will be my first love, but this amethyst is my new primary. amethyst was already my favorite crystal platonically, but having a sexual relationship with it really enhances my connection with it. I come & I see god.
-
@getmaude shine lubricant. out of all of samples of lube that I’ve gotten over the years (& hated them—either because of the smell or consistency or ingredients or all three) this is the first (& only) one that I really really really like? like, it rivals the coconut oil i’ve been using for eons. the consistency is A1 & it’s 100% natural + organic (first ingredient is aloe vera juice). it’s really good & i’m a very tough person to please (triple Virgo!) but @getmaude, I see you.
-
we-vibe touch. after weaning myself off of my vibrator years ago, I swore I’d never go back to the vibrating crack again. but I recently got some gift certificates for @sheboptheshop & decided to feed my curiosity & give it a try once more. I have a lot of feels about using a vibrator again & I plan on writing about this soon. but for now, I’ll say that anything that gives me (a crazy busy babe who doesn’t often have time for a full sex magic session with crystals & intentions) easier access to pleasure & orgasm on a regular basis is a win-win-win. no shame in these vibrations. it’s all in service of the same energy.
