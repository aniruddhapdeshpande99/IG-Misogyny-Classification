Me stepping into Mercury Retrograde likeâ€”
.
Wise ones know that Mercury Retrograde is deeply misunderstood by our mainstream culture and our fear of it is unnecessary. Mercury Retrograde doesnâ€™t want to stress us out or inconvenience usâ€”though those things can happen during this time if we donâ€™t make space for the gift itâ€™s trying to give us, which is: the gift of slowing the fuck down, of moving + acting with intention, of thinking before we speak, of re-evaluating, re-assessing, and releasing all the shit that no longer serves to make space for new.
.
Itâ€™ll test our patience and urge us to be flexible. Itâ€™ll ask us to surrender our rigidity. Itâ€™ll ask us to relinquish our control and trust the process. Mercury Retrograde is basically like, â€œLet go or else be dragged."
.
So, I choose to let go. I choose to surrender to the process and I try to enjoy the ride. I will do the best I can to receive the insights being given to me at this time and I will slow the fuck down enough so that I can fully process them.
.
May these following days of Mercury Retrograde open your mind, lighten your load, and shake loose whatever needs to be dismantled so that you can thrive and shine. ðŸŒŸâœ¨
