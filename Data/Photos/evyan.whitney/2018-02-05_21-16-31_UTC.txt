I was taught some pretty fucked up things about sex and sexuality: the notion that I would be more valuable and loved if my hymen was intact; that I am more worthy of respect if my sexual essence is kept hidden; that my sexuality can only be activated and enlightened by the gazes of men; that my pleasure and agency is secondary. For the longest time, I feared sex and my own desires. I often found no pleasure in the physicality of it, just the visceral sense of shame & guilt.

It was through writing that I began to explore my sexual dysfunction and ignorance. With words, I started to peel back the layers of my shame and trauma, and I started to get curious about what I wanted to believe about sex instead—things that honored and affirmed my sexual identity, things that weren’t steeped in racism, misogynoir, or sexism.

I started publicly chronicling my sexual liberation journey seven years ago and in that time, I’ve realized a few things:

My sexuality is a source of power and with it, I can heal, know, and actualize myself; that there is such thing as erotic joy and I am capable (and worthy) of experiencing that kind of sexual lightness; that pleasure is my birthright; that I am allowed to be desired and to claim my own sexual desires; that sexual shame and stigma, in my feminine lineage, ends with me.

My name is Ev’Yan Whitney and I am a sexually liberated woman.
