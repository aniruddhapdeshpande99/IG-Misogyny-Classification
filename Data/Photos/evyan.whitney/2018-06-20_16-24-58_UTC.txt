Who I am as a queer femme: I am tender and soft (Cancer moon 😬). The way to my pussy is through my heart, which is another way of saying that I’m demisexual—someone who needs to have an emotional connection and emotional intimacy with someone before we can get freaky.
-
I’m a little awkward and I have a hard time having my interest in others be read as sexual because I don’t really know how to flirt—which is something I’m working on.
-
I’m non-monogamous and prefer that term to polyamory because non-monogamy better reflects the kind of relationships I tend to be in. I’m prone to having many crushes at a time and am not shy to be direct and express when I like-like someone (Sagittarius rising 😬).
-
My queer identity is a choice—that is, I actively choose each day to honor and actualize this part of me when I don’t necessarily “have to.” And what I mean by that is: I’m in a long-term committed relationship with a man (@jonathanmead) who’s amazing, we’ve been together for more than a decade. It would’ve been really easy for me to settle for living my life as a “straight person,” and I almost did.
-
But I chose not to because this part of me was more important that my fears and anxieties, more important than any “should” or “right way” to do it.
