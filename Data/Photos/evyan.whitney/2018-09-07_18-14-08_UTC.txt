it’s day three of the #sensualselfiechallenge & the high of the last few days is coming down. we’re being brought back down to earth. we’re being reminded—through gross comments, creepy DMs, concerned messages from family, our censored photos being removed—that this work we’re doing of sensual space-taking and sexual celebration has real consequences. we’re being reminded that in making ourselves radically visible in this way, we’re making ourselves targets—of slut shame, of unsolicited sexualization, of respectability politics.
-
this work is dangerous. it’s threatening the foundations of very old & tired systems of oppression. it’s triggering in people responses to fear us, to be concerned for us, to insert themselves into our sexual narrative, to feel entitled to the fruits of our emotional & sensual labor. & it’s making people very, very uncomfortable.
-
they’re telling us to quiet down. they’re telling us to cover up. they’re trying to censor our radiance, to dim our light. & they’re doing their damnedest to scare us into going back into hiding.
-
our response—we will keep posting. we will keep shining. we will keep taking up space. we will use our anger & our vulnerability  to ignite our boldness, to continue to claim our bodies & sexuality. & we will remember that the responses we’re receiving—as heartbreaking & frustrating & irritating & scary as they are—are a clear sign of cultural revolution.
-
to those who are struggling to take up space again after these violations have driven them back into smallness: hold tight. I’m making something where we’ll get to take up sensual space with each other & celebrate our sexuality outside of the male gaze without the threat of losing our jobs or the respect of our loved ones.
-
hang in there. you are magic.
