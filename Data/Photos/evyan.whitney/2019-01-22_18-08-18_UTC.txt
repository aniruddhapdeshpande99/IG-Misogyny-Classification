I take sensual selfies to subvert the male gaze; to defy & reject respectability politics rooted in white supremacy & patriarchy; to take up space with & celebrate unapologetically my Black queer body.
.
I take (+ post) sensual selfies as an act of resistance in a culture (and on this platform in particular) where s-x sells & at the same time, the empowerment of my s-xuality and having it demonstrate my s-xual agency & the ownership of my s-xual narrative is a violation.
.
I take sensual selfies to get your attention & to underscore how deeply troubling it is that “female nipples” are more policed & regulated on social media platforms than hate speech & racist rhetoric.
.
I take sensual selfies to chronicle my journey of love & acceptance of my body amidst dysmorphia & harmful standards of beauty portrayed in media.
.
I take sensual selfies as one small gesture of solidarity to s-x workers who continue to be silenced, ignored, & whose activism & fight to be heard has paved the way for my own s-xual liberation & expression.
.
I take sensual selfies to help teach other women/femmes to liberate their s-xuality, shift their s-xual self-image, & unpack their own internalized slut shame & body negativity.
.
I take sensual selfies to remind you that my femme body, with clothes or without, is never an invitation to be sexualized or to be f-cked.
.
I take sensual selfies not to titillate you, but to honor & own myself. Because my body, my s-xuality, my power is mine.. If you’re new here, now you know. (& thanks for being here, truly.)

*Note that I am censoring all s-words in this post to comply with Facebook’s (who owns Instagram) new sexual solicitation policy. If you have no idea what that is, look it up. It’s terrible and terrifying.
