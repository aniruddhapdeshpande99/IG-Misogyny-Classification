when was the last time you gave your vagina non-sexual touch?
-
we have oversexualized this part of the body so much that many of us only have a sexual relationship with it. either that, or we have what I call a ‚Äútroubleshooting relationship‚Äù‚Äîwe only pay attention to this part of ourselves when there‚Äôs something wrong: a UTI, pelvic pain, a yeast infection, etc.
-
but what would it look like to have a platonic relationship with your vulva, with your vagina? what would it look like to be able to insert a finger in your vagina & have that act be as benign as if you were touching the inside of your mouth? what would it look like to give your vulva/vagina healing, non-sexual touch?
-
in order to desexualize the vagina on a personal level, we need to practice nurturing a non-sexual relationship with it & prioritize that relationship just as we prioritize the sexual. that starts with demystifying the vulva/vagina (understanding the anatomy & connecting to *your* anatomy intimately), tuning & feeling into its wisdom (body mindfulness/awareness as well as body intuition), and creating a habit of giving it loving, healing touch outside of a sexual context.
-
so, if it feels doable for you, I invite you to give your vulva some loving, gentle, platonic touch today. best times to do that: right out of the shower; after you put coconut oil all over your body; a quick, intentional touch over your clothes throughout the day; right before bed as a winding down ritual. greet your vulva like you would an old friend. reestablish a nurturing, non-sexual relationship with this part of yourself as a way to further the healing & connection with your body.
-
& remember‚Äîyour vulva/vagina is only sexual when it‚Äôs in a sexual context. outside of that context, it can be as neutral a part of your body as your arm or mouth.
let me know how it goes! üíñüíñüíñ
