I\u2019ve actually recommended to a few clients of mine start this course before we work together because sensuality & bodily connection is such foundational world within sexual liberation & healing. I think you would enjoy it & I also think it would be a great place to start before we explore private sessions. if you have any questions, don\u2019t hesitate to email me! evyan@evyanwhitney.com \ud83d\udc93",

I would also recommend Sexual Liberation 101 to unpack the blockages that is coming up for you. & lastly, for fun, I think the Sexting Myself guidebook would be a great way for you to affirm your beauty & sexuality with your own eyes through sensual self-portraiture\u2014which is one of my favorite ways to reconnect with my body & softness when it seems to have gone dormant. I hope this is helpful! be easy on you. \u2728",

I could be totally off the mark with this because I\u2019m reading in between the lines of your comment to determine what the block is. but as you can see, within my work I ask A LOT of follow-up questions to help us both get to the root of what could be blocking you, & unfortunately an IG comment isn\u2019t the best place for a dialogue in that way. that said! in terms of courses, I think Sexual Liberation 101 would be great for you to unpack where you don\u2019t feel safe within your sexual interactions with your partners & how you can feel more safe (or free, or soft, or vulnerable). Sexual Liberation 101 could also help you release any shame you might be feeling about your orgasm, and then create & embody some new stories about it. I hope this was helpful in some way!",

I just spent the last year with no penetrative contact in order to better understand my relationship to sex and desire and intimacy. I'm now in the next phase of learning to experience ecstasy without attachment and am becoming physically intimate again with new people, but it's scary. My old stuff keeps popping up, not just what I am conscious of regarding my previous sexual partners but also the incest wound that was created so early on and crossed all the wires.
