imagine what it would be like if we decentered the penetrative, mutual-orgasm definition of sex and instead defined sex for ourselves. and imagine that in that new definition, we defined sex as anything we do—with ourselves or with another—that centers the consensual pleasure and enjoyment of our body and senses.

we would all be having a lot more sex.

the amount of sex I have per week based on the traditional, limited idea of what sex is vs. the amount of sex I have in the new way I’ve defined sex for myself (anything that centers whole-body pleasure and fully present enjoyment) is striking—from single to double digits. engaging in sex in this way, embodying and practicing this new definition daily, expands my capacity for pleasure and creates more possibility for intimacy, making sex much more accessible and gentle on my body and spirit. it also helps smash pleasure and sex hierarchies—the belief that there is one right way to have sex, one right way to experience pleasure and physical intimacy with someone.

(I would also like to add that this isn’t a novel concept, that folks with disabilities, folks who are queer, folks who have diverse body experiences and needs, have perfected the art of self-defined, the-potential-for-pleasure-is-unlimited sex. listen to them, learn from them, respect them.)

I’ve been thinking a lot about this as I’ve been on an impromptu internet break and I invite you to do the same. what could sex be if there were no pressure to orgasm? if there was no penetration? what would sex be if you could define it? how much more sex do you think you would have if you thought and fucked outside the box? what does sex mean to you? what does it not mean? and how might you be able to create more space to experience non-penetrative sex, orgasm-less sex, clothed sex, slow sex, sensual sex, self-intimate sex in your daily life?
