in 2018, I took up running.  I read 61 books. I didnâ€™t drink alcohol. I spoke to my dad for the first time in almost 7 years. I went to therapy consistently. I isolated myself. I taught 10 workshops and did 4 speaking gigs. I made my house a home. I was in three print magazines. I doubled my income. I took exceptional care of my skin. I went to New York. I was overwhelmed. I asked for more money. I was selfish with my time + energy. I was generous with my time + energy. I ate a lot of pizza. I went on a date. I planted gardens. I asked for help. I got a tattoo. I created community. I spent a lot of time alone. I prayed to my ancestors. I made new friends. I donated $3500 to orgs for black women/femmes. I invested in myself. I was fierce with my boundaries. I ignored my imposter syndrome. I took my work seriously. I let my hair down. I manifested big wishes. I exceeded my expectations.

in 2018, I thrived. I allowed myself to be seen & gave myself permission to expand beyond my own limiting beliefs & falsehoods.

in 2018, I elevated my brand, my business, my vision, my desires, myself above others.

in 2019, I will keep ascending.
