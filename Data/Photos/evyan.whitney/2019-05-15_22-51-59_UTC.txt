*cw: sexual trauma* Even though I can remember the layout of the room, the position of the sun, what jeans I was wearing, and the look on their faces when my body was invaded by unwelcome hands, there's a voice inside of me that still asks, “Are you sure?”
.
“Are you sure that what happened actually happened?” “Are you sure that you weren’t overreacting?” “Are you sure that you weren’t in some way asking for it?”
.
These questions feel like demons that chisel away the belief I have in myself, the stability I have in my own knowing. These questions feel just like the hands that have touched me without my consent, dirtying me up from the inside. These questions are not from my own voice but from the voices of my violators.
.
I’m doing such battle with those voices which try to discredit my own knowing. And I so often side with the voice that tells me I’m making something up or leaving something out, over what my intuition, my memory, tells me about those situations. I always believe my violators—their “good intentions”, their misplaced affections, their confused expressions of love.
.
But what if I believed myself, unequivocally?
.
What if I was totally loyal to the feelings and sensations of my body? What if I operated always from a place of believing my own experiences of violation, not just because I am an advocate for my wellness, but because I know I am an intelligent, reasonable, fully awake human being? What if my “Are you sure?” was replaced with an automatic, “Yes, I believe you”?
.
I think that believing the truth of my experiences would break me open as I would have to face the harsh reality of what they mean for me. But I think I would find liberation there, a new understanding of my own strength and my resilience. I think that is how I would begin to heal.

A new episode of @sexuallyliberatedwoman dropped today and I’m processing a lot. It features a conversation I had with trauma expert @jimanekia about healing & supporting survivors. Check out episode 40 of The Sexually Liberated Woman (link in bio) and as you listen, feel into your body. Give it space to be and process. This episode will release some shit in the best way.

PS: I believe you.
