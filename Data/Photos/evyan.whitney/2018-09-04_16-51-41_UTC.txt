In a world that constantly tells me Iâ€™m not enough, that I should keep my sexuality hidden, taking up space and openly celebrating my softness is a radical act.
So I will take up space.
I will find a home in my body.
I will let my softness be visible.
I will let my sexuality be unshamed.

My #sensualselfiechallenge starts TOMORROW. During this challenge, weâ€™ll be encouraging ourselves to take up space, explore our bodies, and unshame our sexuality through selfie-taking.
