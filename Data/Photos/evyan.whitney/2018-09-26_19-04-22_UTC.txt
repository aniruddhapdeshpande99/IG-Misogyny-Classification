< sound on > getting ready to go out & saying some powerful words to myself to help me feel fierce + safe while I’m showing off my sexual radiance amidst catcalling & the unauthorized objectification of my body. what I’m saying to myself—
-
My sexual liberation is not for male consumption. I’m not doing this for your gaze or for your pleasure. I’m not doing this for your attention or approval.
You are not authorized to claim any of the space I take up in my sexual expression. You are not invited to use my erotic empowerment as a headquarters for your arousal. You are not allowed anywhere within my sexual liberation—you are not the basis for it, you are not the inspiration for it, and you can have no part of it.
-
Just because I speak about enjoying orgasm does not mean I want you to give me one. Just because I take and post sensual selfies does not mean I am inviting you to position yourself at the center of my sexual celebration.
I will not allow you to shrink me or my sexual expression because of your sexual dominance.
-
I’ll say this once more: My sexual liberation has nothing to do with you.
