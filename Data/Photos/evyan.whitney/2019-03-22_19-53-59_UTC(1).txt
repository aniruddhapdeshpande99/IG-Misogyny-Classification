People ask me all the time about what a “sexuality doula” is. My answer:

A “sexuality doula”, as I have defined it, is a person who educates, facilities, and supports people as they transition from shame, fear, and trauma within their sexuality and into a place of sexual freedom and empowerment—whatever that looks like to them. I do this through with teaching courses, facilitating workshops, and working with women and non-binary folks one-on-one in private sessions to help them heal and liberate their sexuality.

As a sexuality doula I help you release sexual trauma, I help you reclaim your orgasm and prioritize your pleasure, I help you honor your sexual identity—from kink to orientation. Basically, I help you find your power as a sexual being and we work together to create and reclaim a sexual expression that is underneath the taboos, fear, and shame. And I do all of that while drawing from my own experience as someone who has studied sex and sexuality for the last decade and has gone through hell and back trying to heal her own self sexually.

I’m very grateful to full-spectrum doula for gifting me with the language of “sexuality doula” which I now use as the basis of my work—I'm also in the process of getting it trademarked in 2019 (very excited about this!). My work is constantly expanding and evolving and I’m honored when places like @iamwellandgood recognize me and give me some shine. Never in a million years did I think I’d be doing what I do right now, but now I can’t imagine doing anything else.

If you’d like to learn more about my work as a sexuality doula, go to my website evyanwhitney.com (link in bio) and explore. You can also listen my podcast @sexuallyliberatedwoman where you can hear my work in action (ep. 37 and 38 are great places to start). And big love to @glowmaven for interviewing me for Well + Good this week. I’m beyond honored.
