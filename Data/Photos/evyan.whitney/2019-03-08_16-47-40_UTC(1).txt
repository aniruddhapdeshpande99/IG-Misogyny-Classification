I'm so thrilled to finally announce that I'll be hosting a two-part sensual event in LA alongside my favorite crystal dildo company, @chakrubs.

Part one (4-6 PM) will be my intimate sensual selfie workshop, Sexting Myself, where I'll teach you how to take selfies to help you liberate and celebrate your sexuality. (SOLD OUT)
.
Part two (6-10 PM) will be a community party where we'll take up sensual space and play with tarot readings by @tarotviews, a short-film screening, a sound bath facilitated by @vanessa_cuccia (the founder of @chakrubs), dancing, drinks, a raffle of sensual goodies (including a 1:1 sexual liberation session with yours truly), and so much more.
âž–
All of this is happening on Saturday, March 30th, 4:00 â€” 10:00 PM at @Navel.la in Downtown Los Angeles.
âž–
Come for one part of the event or stay for the whole night. Either way, this is going to be an evening of sensual space-taking and sexual empowerment.
