I remember being eight & pressing my nipples as hard as I could into my chest to try to get them soft again after getting out of the swimming pool. I remember being fourteen & buying extra padded bras to help hide my nipples when they got hard in my excessively air-conditioned classrooms. I remember being sixteen & putting duct tape over my nipples so that they wouldn't show over my favorite backless top. I remember being twenty-three & crossing my arms tightly over my chest like I was cold to make sure if my nipples got hard, no one would see. I remember being twenty-six & deleting all pictures that even hinted that my nipples existed. & just the other day, I put a jacket on in the hot sun because the fabric of the shirt I was wearing was thin & I felt more comfortable being covered up - just in case. 
religion taught me to see my female body as sinful. culture taught me to see my female body as a danger. I am teaching myself how to bring self-love & radical acceptance to that which is not flawed or inherently sexual but natural & healthy. 
it's hard, because while I know what I was taught was / is bullshit, these lessons are pervasive & old & challenging to release. it's always in the back of my mind that to most people, my body, just by being & doing what it's supposed to do, is a titillation. it's always in the back of my mind that just my existence as a woman presenting as femme invites unwanted attention. but as much as I want to shrink myself sometimes, I keep reminding myself that my body is not offensive, my body is not a titillation, & the conditioning I was given about it is false, oppressive, & sexist. I'm still learning.
