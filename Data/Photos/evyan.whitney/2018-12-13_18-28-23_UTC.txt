Before I felt my body expand at the touch of another. Before I was brought to my knees by a tsunami of heartache. Before I found unconditional love in my beloved’s shining eyes—

I was mine.

My first love, my first home. My first understanding of companionship + my first great romance was between me and my heartbeat and my skin and the heat created by those things. That’s where it all began.

Sometimes it’s hard to comprehend this. Sometimes I neglect the specialness of this relationship, this blessed union that was created from the time I was born. Sometimes I forget where I came from.

But it started here, in this body, in my bones.
We—me and my body—are lovers.

This love is rooted in radical acceptance. This love asks nothing of me except gentle questions that prompt me to continue to uncover my truth—What do you desire? How do you feel? Who are you becoming? This love fosters authenticity, agency, sovereignty. This love is big.

I am not perfect at keeping this love strong and present. I forget it often. I lose grip of it often. I often fail to remember how powerful it is. But I always manage to return to myself. Always.
