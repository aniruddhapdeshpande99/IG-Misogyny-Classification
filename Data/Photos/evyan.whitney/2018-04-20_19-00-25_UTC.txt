if your sexual liberation (or sex education, or sexual healing practices) caters to the male gaze; if it lives on gender essentialism; if it speaks only to & about cis white hetero folks; if it uses new-age spiritual jargon that promotes the belief that “sacred sexuality” (i.e., anything that doesn’t involve the more “unevolved” expressions of sexuality, like casual sex or nude selfies or slut walks or the radical notion that a woman’s nipples should be desexualized) is the “right way” to do sexual empowerment; if it’s anti-woman, anti-hoe, anti-feminist, ableist, not inclusive of other genders; if it’s racist, classist, or has its roots deep in patriarchy; if it slut shames or dismisses others’ certain methods of erotic empowerment that counters your own—it is not sexual liberation & IDFWU.

I will forever & unconditionally be for your sexual liberation—whatever that looks like—& I will continue to use my voice to speak up fiercely against these fair-weathered sexual liberationists with their fake & harmful “sex-positive” personas.

& to anyone who thinks that my taking sensual, nude-ish selfies & flaunting my body as a form of feminine empowerment means that I am "disrespecting my temple”, & that I don’t really love myself because if I did I wouldn’t be degrading myself as a sex object—you can catch these twerks.
