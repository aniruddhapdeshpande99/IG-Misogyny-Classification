bitch, don’t I look like a pharaoh?!

today, I’m luxuriating in the juicy fruits of my labor. I’m celebrating myself for all that I’ve been through & accomplished. I’m welcoming all of the pleasure, abundance, & opulence en route to me & I’m giving myself permission to claim it as my birthright.

I’ve been working so hard to get to where I am at currently with my career & to finally be getting the recognition, respect, & support for my expertise feels like wearing a gold crown. also the fact that the sun is out & I can wear a tank top comfortably without freezing is doing wonders for my mental health.

goddamn, I’m glowed up. ✨ thank you for witnessing my radiance.
