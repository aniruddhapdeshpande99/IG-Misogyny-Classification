When do you feel the most free? The most at ease? When you find your body softening and your breath relaxing, what are you doing? What does freedom feel like through your senses? In what ways are you advocating for your freedom? How are you claiming it as yours?

When do you feel the least free? The most inhibited? When your body is tensing and your breath is holding, what are you doing? What does repression/suppression feel like through your senses? In what ways are you compromising your own freedom? What are you tethered to?

Been thinking a lot about freedom lately and wrote out these questions for my own self-exploration. Feel welcome to use them for yourself. You can also share what immediately comes to you below; I’d love to witness. (But if you repost these questions, I’d appreciate being credited.)
