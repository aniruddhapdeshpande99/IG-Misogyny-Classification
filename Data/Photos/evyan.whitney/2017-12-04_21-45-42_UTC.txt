My name is Ev'Yan - pronounced EV-Yahn. My mom considered a couple different spellings of my name before deciding on what I have now. (Despite popular belief, she was not at all influenced by that French water brand.) She wanted a name for me that sounded melodic, a tribute to her and my father’s love of music (my parents were songwriters and musicians). My middle name, Whitney, is also a tribute to music via the late Whitney Houston, who serendipitously ended up being my favorite singer when I was a child. My mom says that when I was about one or two years old, I used to carry around a beat up CD case for Whitney’s album “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” like a teddy bear. I couldn’t say “Whitney” back then and could only pronounce it as “Wee-nit” and “Wee-deet.”

I hated my name as I entered my teens. It othered me, isolated me, made me stick out like a sore thumb amongst the Ashleys, Jennifers, and Nicoles. I went through a phase where I only wanted to be called “Eva” (pronounced EV-uh) because it was shorter and easier to spell, and then later “Erika” because it was simpler and more palatable. Even when I decided to keep some semblance of my original name, I dropped the apostrophe altogether (making it “Evyan” - pronounced ev-EE-yahn) because explaining it to people as I spelled it out was tedious (it still is).

It wasn’t until my twenties that I started to fully embrace my given name. There wasn’t a special moment that brought me to accepting it; I think one day I just decided to stop fighting it. Funnily enough, this happened right around the time I started to become serious about being a writer. It is humorous to me that the one thing I am most proud of in my life - the work that I do and the business I built - is carried by the name I tried to run from. Can you imagine if I had went through with it and changed my name? Erika Whitney just doesn’t have the same ring to it.
