the face of a black queer woman who is afraid to leave her house because of racism, homophobia, & sexism.
I haven't been feeling my magic or radiance. all I've been feeling is scared & depressed & anxious & tired. but also really fucking angry that my magic & radiance is being stifled & stolen by ignorance & awful people. I have important work to do, yet here I am cycling through anxious thoughts all day about getting gay bashed or called the n-word or worse. I don't feel safe in my skin or my identity. I don't feel safe to walk down the street & hold my white husband's hand. I don't feel safe to take up space. I just stay indoors & pray that things begin to calm down enough that I can walk to the store to buy groceries by myself without having a panic attack, but I fear that they won't.
this is the face of a black queer woman who is tired & frightened but trying to hold on to her own light, which is very dim & weakening.
