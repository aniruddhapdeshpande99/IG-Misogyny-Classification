‪Your sexual liberation—the pursuit of it, the embodiment of it, the unshaming of it—is an act of resistance.

It’s an act of resistance against any trauma and/or violation you experienced.

It’s an act of resistance against a culture that prioritizes and centers the male gaze, a culture that fears femme sexuality + erotic power, telling it to stay small, quiet, and submissive while also telling it to make itself better of proper use to men’s pleasure and desires.

It’s an act of resistance against those who wish to take away your bodily autonomy and refuse to see you as sovereign, trustworthy, wise.

It’s an act of resistance against every person and/or system of oppression that has shamed you and told you that your liberated sexuality isn’t yours to claim.

It’s an act of resistance against every lie you’ve ever been told—that you are not enough, that you are not desirable, that your orgasm is too complicated, that your pleasure doesn’t deserve to be centered, that you don’t have a say, that there is something wrong with you.

And it’s a radical gesture that brings healing to not just you but to all the people who came before you who were not able to fully embody sexual freedom.

So—in what ways are you pursuing your sexual liberation? What are you actively doing to embody sexual freedom so that it becomes muscle memory? (One of my philosophies is that we shift old stories/shame around our sexuality by embodying/doing the opposite.) And what shame(s) needs to be released in order for you begin healing so that you can become an advocate for your necessary, holy, radical erotic power?

Screengrab these affirmations; say them to yourself daily. And journal out those questions; stay curious. These are great first steps to sexual liberation.
