These retrogrades have me processing a lot, and Iâ€™ve found a lot of comfort + healing in dancing as a way to sift through whatâ€™s been coming up and help my body release and unstick stagnant energy. Iâ€™ve tried sitting meditation and itâ€™s never worked for me. My body wants to move as it processes and regrounds itself. So, I use sensual dance meditation as a form of self-care as well as a practice of spiritual connection. Hereâ€™s what my practice looks like, and if youâ€™ve also struggled with sitting meditation and want to use dance/movement to connect to your body + emotions, give this a try. Also check out the playlist I made if you want to take the guesswork out of what youâ€™ll be dancing to. Just click the link in my bio or search â€˜sensual dance meditationâ€™ in Spotify.

Leave a comment with any questions you have about this form of meditation. Iâ€™m happy to help if I can. ðŸ’«ðŸ’›
