this is an update about my relationship.

it’s not owed to anyone, but it is something that I’ve been wanting to put into the open because intentionally avoiding it has been tiresome. I’ve also just haven’t been ready to talk about it, but I am now.

so. after nearly 14 years of being together, me and my partner @jonathanmead decided at the beginning of this year to put intentional physical distance between us. we are living apart—together.

it's a very long, complicated story, and I've decided to share this story on my podcast, @sexuallyliberatedwoman—not just because I enjoy podcasting, but because my podcast is where I go to speak about my own journey of healing and liberation in the realms of sex, relationships, and my own identity. so it just feels right to talk about my “separation" there. (you can listen to ep. 48 of The Sexually Liberated Woman on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, etc. just for it or click the link in my bio.) this has challenged us both deeply—yet, there is still so much love between us. and we both have already seen how transitioning our relationship in this way has given us space to honor our individual freedom while creating new ways to stay connected with each other.

this relationship continues to be a safe space for me to be the entire truth of myself, and I’m so grateful to be supported with a love that allows me to stay free.

i love you, jonathan.
