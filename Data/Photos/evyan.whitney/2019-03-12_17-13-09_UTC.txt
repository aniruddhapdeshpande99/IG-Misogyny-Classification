I still struggle with pleasure hierarchies within my sexuality—ideas that tell me there's one method of achieving sexual pleasure that’s better than others, and this pleasure hierarchy says that me attaining pleasure from a vibrating toy is at the bottom.

I can’t pinpoint where I learned this crap, but I’ve been working hard to dismantle this falsehood recently, not just because it’s nonsense but because it’s been holding my pleasure hostage. And one of the best ways I’ve found to destroy it has been by using the very tool the pleasure hierarchy has taught me is for the non-sexually enlightened: My vibrator. And not just when I’m by myself, but also when I’m with my partner.

Whenever I take out my @wevibe Touch, it’s not just a chance for me to have an orgasm, it’s a gesture that proactively subverts the old story and falsehood of the pleasure hierarchy. When I come with it, I’m literally rewriting unproductive sexual narratives and empowering myself to create new stories that support, honor, and center my pleasure. Win-win-win.

@WeVibe inspires people to discover pleasure through more passionate and playful time whether on your own or with a partner. My Touch has helped me access and prioritize my pleasure in moments when I’ve previously shied away from it. When I give myself permission to indulge and enjoy, my pleasure and orgasm are no longer boxed in.
