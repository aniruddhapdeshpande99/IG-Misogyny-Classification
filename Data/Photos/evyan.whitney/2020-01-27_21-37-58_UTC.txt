I JUST GOT A NEW APARTMENT!!! ✨ your favorite sexuality doula™ is finally moving back home and into her dream apartment in Los Angeles next week!!! I am so excited and relieved to be leaving the Pacific Northwest. this has been a long long time coming and I have so much to share about it. trust that I’ll be giving the full rundown of what’s been going on behind the scenes on my podcast @sexuallyliberatedwoman very soon (I’ve been on hiatus due to being in limbo regarding my living situation!). in the meantime, I want to thank myself for being patient and trusting/listening to my intuition regarding this move—even when it was excruciating. I want to thank my ancestors for guiding me throughout this journey and for helping me manifest this space. I want to thank all of my friends/chosen fam for holding space for me as I made (and continue to make) some very big + scary transitions in my life—y’all know who you are. mad props also go out to my fellow Black boss witches who divined for me, held me, and lent their magic to help me secure this spot: @itsjujubae @iamsatarra @hausofhoodoo @maryamajayi @thehouseofoshun @myeshxa @nettasdivinetarot @mssweetdee. & big big love to @arilennox whose song ‘new apartment’ kept me grounded in my intentions.

big things are coming y’all, I can’t wait to share this next phase of my life/work with you. ✨ please celebrate with me!
