y’all have been asking me about my skincare  regimen all year & I’m finally gonna reveal it all here for your viewing pleasure. (👉🏾 scroll through for a “shelfie.”)
.
☀️ morning—
cleanse with water + flannel cloth; apply @herbivore’s pink clay mask; rinse then tone with rose water; moisturize with five drops of rosehip oil + one drop of castor; massage in oil with a warmed @chakrubs rose quartz facial roller.
.
🌙 evening—
cleanse with water + flannel cloth; tone with rose water; apply @madhippieskinproducts vitamin C serum; let sit, then apply @farmacybeauty Honeymoon Glow night serum.

a few notes: I do not mask everyday, only a couple times a week. if I’m wearing makeup, I remove it with coconut oil. occasionally I’ll do a sheet mask or get a facial, but my skin seems to thrive on a simple regimen with natural ingredients.

BUT my secret weapon for my skincare has been seed cycling. ever since I started that this year, my breakouts have decreased dramatically. I swear by it & I break it down a bit in the comments. but if you wanna know more, google “Danielle Cornelius seed cycling”. grateful to @drdaniellecornelius for helping convert me.

I’m still battling a few stubborn dark spots on my cheeks from healed breakouts, but I’m proud of how well I’ve been taking care of my precious. 😬🏆 (PS—this is not an ad, just wanted to share my faves with you.)
