in 2017, I turned 30; read 28 books from my local library; cleared up my skin; moved house; found my chosen family; made a lot of money by myself; took up running; wore my hair primarily in braids as an act of rebellion against white supremacy; tried to keep things simple; signed up for Tinder - then deleted it; shaved my legs for the first time in 4+ years (& promptly regretted it); sent my dad a text after not speaking to him for 6 years; got back into therapy (because of that last one); bought a lot of plants; organized & created safe spaces for femmes & women of color in my city; hurt some people; kept in consistent contact with my ancestors; learned how to use highlight on my face; had more than a few depressive episodes; did not use any substances; took up a lot of space with my sexuality & sexual body; masturbated a lot; embraced my Virgoness; celebrated 11 years with @jonathanmead; saw four amazing concerts (Solange, Radiohead, Broken Social Scene, & A Perfect Circle); stood up to an abusive rape apologist; performed on stage twice, only got sick once, & continued to be unapologetically black.

in 2017, I found my voice.
in 2018, Iâ€™m going to use it.
