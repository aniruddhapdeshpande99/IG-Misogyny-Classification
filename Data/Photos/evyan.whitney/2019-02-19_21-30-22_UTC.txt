I spent 20+ years on this earth and in this body feeling afraid of + disconnected from my sexuality. I honestly never thought that sexual liberation was possible for me because I identified so deeply with stories and narratives of shame that discouraged me from exploring or finding safety within my sexuality. The fact that I am where I am with my sexuality now has deep meaning.

These days, my sexual liberation looks like me being at peace with my sexuality. It looks like me affirming myself and taking up space as a sexual woman. It looks like me centering and advocating for my pleasure in every aspect of my life, not just the sexual. It looks like me divesting from systems of oppression that have taught me to shame, fear, shrink, and apologize for my sexuality. It looks like me taking full ownership of the desires and curiosities I have while also giving myself permission to seek and explore.

Everything I am today is a result of a lot of deep and challenging work I’ve done to unshame and reclaim my sexuality. It didn’t happen overnight. It started when I made the conscious choice ten years ago to finally heal + liberate my sexuality. Because nobody was going to do it for me; I had take my power back from those old stories and be the narrator of my sexual story.

Now, I am my own muse.

If you are someone who wants to liberate their sexuality but hasn’t known where to start, join me in my new course, Sexual Liberation 101. I created this course from the very method I used when I began my own sexual liberation journey. It’s gentle, it’s simple, it’s transformational.
