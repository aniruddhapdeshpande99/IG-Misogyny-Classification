selfies that I didn’t post but I should’ve posted in 2019 (& the honest reasons why I didn’t):
-
1. I was afraid that this censored, non-sexual photo would be removed, & I didn’t want to take up too much space.

2. I didn’t want to take up too much space.

3. I didn’t want to take up too much space.

4. I didn’t like my facial expression, and I was afraid that I was taking up too much space.

5. I didn’t like how much I looked like my father, and I didn’t want to take up too much space.

6. I didn’t like how broad my shoulders looked, and I didn’t want to take up too much space.

7. I was afraid to take up too much space.

every selfie I took + posted this year went through a rigorous invisible screening process where my inner critical demon tried to convince me that I was doing too much & asked if the post (if I) was relevant. it’s true that I do post selfies when I’m feeling myself—but not before it gets processed through my self-doubt, critical thoughts, & fear of being seen & rejected. those voices win most days which is why I will always always say that taking & posting my selfies is a radical act.

may 2020 help me find more confidence to take up space; may it help me learn how to validate my own humanity; and may it lead to the eradication of the belief that I am simultaneously too much & not enough.
