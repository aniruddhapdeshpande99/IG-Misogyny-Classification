Let’s take up space and celebrate our sexuality.
➖
Next Wednesday, join me and a squad of sensual babes—@galadarling, @ethereal.1, @blacklorelei7, and @4locrow—in another round of the #sensualselfiechallenge.
The goal: Take one selfie a day for five days that highlights your body, celebrates your sexuality, and encourages you to take up space. And we (the squad) will guide you along the way with prompts, affirmations, inspiration, and encouragement.
➖
How to play with us:
‣ go to bit.ly/sensualselfie & sign up for the challenge
‣ follow me on Instagram (if you’re not already)
‣ set your profile to public (so we can see your selfies)
‣ follow the hashtag #sensualselfiechallenge so you can see other people’s selfies
-
Participate daily for a chance to win a spot in my wildly popular (& always sold out) course, Sexting Myself.

*You do not have to be nude in order to play in the challenge* This isn’t about titillation. It’s about making an intention for the next five days to use self-portraiture as a way of delighting in your beauty, body, and sensual essence. And you can do so fully clothed.

Challenge officially starts Sep. 5th! Link in bio to join.
Tag a babe you want to do this with 💁🏾‍♀️✨
