self-admiration as a political act.
self-celebration as a political act.
flaunting myself as a political act.

gazing in the mirror & unabashedly admiring my beauty, my softness, my melanin, my body in its reflection, during a time when I’m “supposed” to shrink myself & be modest as a political act.
