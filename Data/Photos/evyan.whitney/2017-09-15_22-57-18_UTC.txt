In my twenties, I started my own business. I reclaimed my queer identity. I got married. I moved to the pacific northwest. I became radicalized in my blackness. I went on antidepressants. I made my own money. I stepped into my erotic power.
In my thirties, all I want to do is be free.
Happy 30th birthday to me. ðŸŽˆðŸŽ‰
