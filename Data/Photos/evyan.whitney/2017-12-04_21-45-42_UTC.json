(Despite popular belief, she was not at all influenced by that French water brand.) She wanted a name for me that sounded melodic, a tribute to her and my father\u2019s love of music (my parents were songwriters and musicians). My middle name, Whitney, is also a tribute to music via the late Whitney Houston, who serendipitously ended up being my favorite singer when I was a child. My mom says that when I was about one or two years old, I used to carry around a beat up CD case for Whitney\u2019s album \u201cI Wanna Dance With Somebody\u201d like a teddy bear. I couldn\u2019t say \u201cWhitney\u201d back then and could only pronounce it as \u201cWee-nit\u201d and \u201cWee-deet.\u201d\n\u2022\nI hated my name as I entered my teens. It othered me, isolated me, made me stick out like a sore thumb amongst the Ashleys, Jennifers, and Nicoles. I went through a phase where I only wanted to be called \u201cEva\u201d (pronounced EV-uh) because it was shorter and easier to spell, and then later \u201cErika\u201d because it was simpler and more palatable. Even when I decided to keep some semblance of my original name, I dropped the apostrophe altogether (making it \u201cEvyan\u201d - pronounced ev-EE-yahn) because explaining it to people as I spelled it out was tedious (it still is).\n\u2022\nIt wasn\u2019t until my twenties that I started to fully embrace my given name. There wasn\u2019t a special moment that brought me to accepting it; I think one day I just decided to stop fighting it. Funnily enough, this happened right around the time I started to become serious about being a writer. It is humorous to me that the one thing I am most proud of in my life - the work that I do and the business I built - is carried by the name I tried to run from. Can you imagine if I had went through with it and changed my name? Erika Whitney just doesn\u2019t have the same ring to it.\n\u2022\nTell me about your name. . .\n\u2796\nThis photo was taken by my amazingly talented friend @extracelestial for her photo series, #portlandincolor.

According to my parents, my name means 'free.' I was born on the nation's birthday and have always been a free-willed person, so I can say I was very aptly named. Because I'm a community worker, I have the name conversation several times a week, if not more. I've never minded setting people straight on it and have long found it odd when people don't fight for their names --I was an adult before I understood I was a unusual in this regard! I have the added oddity in that my first and surnames make people assume I am white, until they meet me. Many awkward conversations have ensued. \ud83d\ude44I'm so glad for this name, however. Glad that my parents were a hippie & a revolutionary, respectively and into Afrocentric culture. I feel very, very lucky.

I had the easy hard name. I too was a name corrector- always wanting to pronounce others names correctly (like Phoebe above) because, although I had an easy odd name, I realized others had odd odd names.

My name is Katarzyna, and it's a very common name in Poland, where I'm from, especially among women of my generation. In Poland people tend to use diminutive versions of names, in this case mine was Kasia. It's a very sweet name and it was ok when I was called like that by my friends and family or when I was a young girl, but as I was getting older, I was not comfortable with this version. It felt like it's inappropriate for a stranger to call me that, since it felt too personal or too \"sweet\". I tried to figure out a different name for myself, but nothing really sticked, I guess polish people are very conservative about names... Whenever I was introducing myself as Katarzyna, people would assume straight away they could call me Kasia. It's in the culture I guess, but it was irritating, especially when I was way into my 20s. Then I moved abroad, and here nobody called me anything other then my real name. I started using \"Katarzyna\" or, to make it shorter, Kat. I love both of these versions and I use both of them. They feel really true to me :) Now, when somebody calls me Kasia, even within my family, it feels very strange, I don't identify with this name anymore. I know if I was living in Poland it wouldn't stick though, especially \"Kat\". It sounds too foreign.",

Even into adulthood it\u2019s hard for me to accept it. Adults and children alike constantly misspelled and mispronounced it on purpose or on accident, even teachers and bosses at jobs. I still struggle to accept my name because of that and the trauma associated with my bio-parents. \nMy first name is, sadly not after the way cooler (and far less pasty and uncoordinated) than me funk - pop band from the 80s/90s. Though learning about them has been a treat. \nI\u2019m named after the cameo style of carved jewels that have silhouettes or angels on them typically. \nPersonally, I\u2019ve always hated all three of my names. And still struggle with it. But I\u2019ve realized most of this is just a response to how I\u2019ve been treated because of my name. Which is ironic considering most people I have bonded with over this experience have been different from me culturally/racially/ethnically and have far more beautiful significance for their names than I do - and very different and scarier traumas associated with their names oftentimes. I am glad my experiences have hopefully helped me be a good friend to them. \nMy biological mom used to call me \u201cCC\u201d. Because my middle name is \u201cCherith\u201d - the river in the Bible where Elijah was fed by the ravens. I\u2019ve tried desperately much of my life to not tell people it but I\u2019ve been learning to find the beauty in it one day at a time. I still go by CC and I like it but I\u2019ve started taking it off school documents. Because I only did that to make things easier for other people and not be embarassed and humiliated or have to correct people. I dislike correcting people and the constant comments about my name. Even the compliments sometimes seem backhanded. \nBut, in some ways I am like you. Learning to own my name and make it beautiful for me, make it truly mine. Me and my name against the world. \nThank you for sharing this. It really helped me honestly. I know so few people who have unique names honestly, and it can be tough sometimes for sure. Loved the backstory on your name. Definitely has a beautiful ring to it and seems to fit you \u2764\ufe0f",
