this has been a year of wanting—of allowing myself to want, of expanding the wants that I have, of challenging myself to prioritize & finally actualize my wants. as someone who has been told most of her life to be small, to want—to desire—is a radical act. & I want a lot.
I want supreme comfort. I want to breathe easy. I want to experience pleasure & sensuality in every moment I’m on this earth. I want to be the best at what I do. I want more sex. I want more rest, more downtime. I want a paramour. I want money—lots & lots of money. I want more time with my family. I want opulence; I’m so tired of denying myself of my taste for luxury & nice things. I want radiant, clear skin. I want more magic in my life, more spirituality. I want to be revered & celebrated for my work. I want to be on the cover of magazines. I want to be paid handsomely for what I do. I want to write a book. I want to fall deeper in love with my husband. I want to travel to tropical climates. I want to have so much that I never want for anything.
I want I want. I deserve what I want. I will have what I want.
