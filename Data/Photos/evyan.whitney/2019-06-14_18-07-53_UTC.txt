I used to say that I hated meditating, but then I realized it was because I was doing it wrong. Sitting down crosslegged in stillness has never resonated with me, and now I know why: I’m meant to move.

Sensual dance meditation is how I connect to my body + senses. It’s how I communicate with my ancestors and tap into my inner wisdom. I’ve also used it to cast spells and manifest abundance. This practice has been so profound for me that I’ve started facilitating sensual dance practices for my clients who are in the process of bringing connection and acceptance to their bodies + sensuality outside of stories of trauma and shame.

Sensual dance meditation is simple—just turn on some music you love and give your body permission to move you without judgment or inhibition. Sensual dance meditation is about being present with your breath, senses, and any emotions that arise. It’s about giving your body space to be soft. It’s about surrender and communion.

Shoutout to @itsjujubae whose recent divination gifted me with the insight that music + dance is how I’m meant to communicate with my ancestors; and to @lalalopez and @neyon_tree whose own sensual dance movements have helped me see what’s possible.
