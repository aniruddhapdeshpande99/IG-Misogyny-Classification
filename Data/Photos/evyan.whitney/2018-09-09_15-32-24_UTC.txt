This is it. The last day of the #sensualselfiechallenge. By now, you‚Äôve seen the power of this practice of sensual space-taking. You‚Äôve come out of your shell. You've witnessed parts of yourself that have been kept in hiding for years. You've begun to shift your sexual self-image and return to the home that is your body. And the question I have for you now is this‚Äî
-
Do you want to go back to the way things were before, back to hiding your sexual radiance? Or do you want to take this incredible momentum you‚Äôve cultivated and turn it into a lasting transformation? (Comment ‚Äúyes‚Äù if you‚Äôre with me.)
-
And in the spirit of your Yes, and to close out the #sensualselfiechallenge, I'm prompting you to embody the softness and strength, the sensuality and power, of someone who is committed to making their sexual liberation and sensual expression a priority (because I know you are). My affirmations for you‚Äî
-
When I am soft, I am strong. When I am connected to my senses, my body, my breath, my sexuality, I am powerful.
-
When I let my sensual light shine and be visible, I become a beacon of healing and representation for others. I give them permission to access the soft, bold, vulnerable, unashamed parts of themselves.
-
I will keep nurturing and deepening this relationship I've created with my sensuality because I know that when I give space for my softness, I empower and I heal.
-
PS! I've created the perfect way for you to continue exploring taking up space with your sensuality and sexuality with the same kind of magical community we‚Äôve created here. So, #sensualselfiechallenge babes‚Äîkeep your eyes on your inbox. I‚Äôll share it with you tomorrow.

This is only the beginning. üåπ
