a friendly reminder to stay regular on your gynecological exams. I got mine done today and the doctor told me my cervix looked great and was slightly open—which is what it does when you’re about to start your period. I’ve actually seen + felt my cervix before and she’s really cute. she’s pinkish-red and felt soft & squishy like I was touching the tip of my nose.

have you ever seen your cervix before? what does it look like? (& if you wanna see/feel yours, I wrote a comment below that teaches you how.)
