It’s been a week since the piece I co-wrote “Dildon’t Disrespect Black Femmes” was released (link in bio), which detailed the disturbing experiences I and other Black sexuality educators and influencers have had with @wildflowersex. Lots of you have been wondering what’s been going on. Me too. This video gives you an update on what’s been happening.

The one thing that I didn’t go into detail about in this video is the compensation thing. As of this posting, I have not received any “compensation” from WF. But I want to be clear: for me, this isn’t about money or receiving “backpay”. This is about WF being transparent about what they did and naming it not as a “mistake” but as calculated and intentional behavior rooted in anti-blackness and white supremacy.

For a full rundown of everything that’s happened—from their politician apologies to the messy ways they’ve handled this entire situation—at check out the #wildflowersux highlight on my profile.

I am exhausted. Please keep pressing @wildflowersex about what they’re going to do to hold themselves accountable and ask them to do the necessary work to make sure that this never happens again. Thank you for your support.
