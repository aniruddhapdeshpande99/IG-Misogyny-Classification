I am breaking my silence today and coming forward to tell my story about some disturbing experiences I’ve had during my personal and professional relationship with @wildflowersex that have left me feeling manipulated, used, and disrespected. Some unfortunate events happened two weeks ago where my ethics were called into question by WF in a way that almost cost me a speaking gig, and immediately after it happened it shed light on a pattern of behavior by them that seems to target Black femmes in this space specifically. After bearing witness to the ways other folks who’ve worked with WF have felt harmed by them, me and some of these Black femmes are coming forward with what we’ve experienced and are asking for your attention and help in uplifting our stories.

We have made ourselves vulnerable and detailed our experiences in a collective post which you can find at bit.ly/wildflowersux (or click the link in my bio). I and the folks coming forward do not intend to cause harm with our choice to speak out about our experiences with @wildflowersex. On the contrary, I am specifically coming forward because I do not want this cycle of disrespect to continue by two people and a brand with a lot of reach and presence in our community, a presence that particularly positions itself as inclusive, intersectional, and safe (all of which, in my opinion, are not accurate). I ask that I am heard and that my hurt and anger is validated and witnessed. I ask that I am given support and solidarity as I make myself incredibly vulnerable by sharing my experiences. I ask that I am believed, and I ask that that belief is extended to the other Black femmes speaking out.

@ashleighchubbybunny @lisaspliffson @venuscuffs @luhshawnay and anyone else who has felt harmed by WF—I stand with you and have your back.

Listen to Black femmes. Believe Black femmes. And put your body where your politics/values are.
