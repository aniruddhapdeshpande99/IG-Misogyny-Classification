OMG I’m in @rollingstone! ✨ I knew this feature was coming but I didn’t think it would be out so soon! Shoutout to a follower who DM’d me and said they were in the Chicago airport looking through the mag and saw me featured; I wouldn’t have known this was out of it weren’t for you! And shout out to the cute lil angel at Walgreens who helped me find the mag and then was like, “Actually, you look like someone in here. Her name is Whitney or something...” and then proceeded to fangirl when I told her shyly, “That’s actually me.” 🥰 To see myself front and center in such an iconic magazine and to be featured alongside @eileen ... this “hot sex educator” is feeling hella jazzed and proud. ⭐️ (photo by: @extracelestial)
