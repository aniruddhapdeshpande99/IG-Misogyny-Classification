in my 30th year, I grew beyond my own limits. I took risks that I thought would end me. I surprised myself, delighted myself with my grace & power. I embodied my magic & shined my light. I elevated my worth, my vision, my dreams. I found new & unknown reserves of strength, tenacity, & courage. I manifested big wishes. I made my presence known. I lived my best life.

may my 31st year bring to me more light, more truth, more kindness, more acceptance. may I find solid ground in the foundations of my truth. may I explore every inch of my passions & realize every aspect of my dreams. may I be intentional with my energy & generous with self-compassion. may abundance find me & Spirit hold me. may the voice of my truth be louder & stronger than the voice of lack, fear, insecurity, or self-doubt. may I always know (& never question) my power.

happy birthday to me âœ¨
