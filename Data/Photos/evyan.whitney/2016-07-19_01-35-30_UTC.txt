my first selfie in two weeks & the first time I've felt sensual in two weeks. I'm feeling more capable today, which means this depression might be loosening its grip on me. I'm not rejoicing yet, not until my black pride comes back, but I'm feeling happy that I'm taking up some space again. thanks to everyone for your love & encouragement. 🌷💗💐💜
