look, ma! Iâ€™m in @glamourmag! âœ¨ Iâ€™ve been waiting to announce this until I could get my hands on a physical copy, but Iâ€™m too excited & itâ€™s also too cold outside to try to go out & find one, so Iâ€™m just going to use this digitized version as proof. âž– whenever I end up in print itâ€™s a huge honor, but this one is particularly special because itâ€™s the last ever print issue of Glamour (theyâ€™re going digital after this). so itâ€™s pretty monumental, especially to have my work highlighted in this way alongside @freeandnative & @alexiwasser (who I used to follow way way back during my fashion blogging days). big love + thanks go to @mollyoswaks for making this happen & to my client, Kait, who spoke so highly of her experience working with me. & shoutout to @extracelestial who shot this photo of me in her tiny kitchen last year!!!!âž– the full feature is out now in their January issue. ðŸ’–
