Sexual liberation 101: If sexual liberation is trying to make you be someone you’re not, it’s not sexual liberation.

True sexual liberation—one that honors where you’re at while encouraging you to be curious about who you want to be—will give you room to explore and express yourself in ways that feel light and gentle. That’s how I teach it and that’s what I want for you.

If you are someone who wants to liberate their sexuality but hasn’t known where to start, join me in my new course, Sexual Liberation 101.

In Sexual Liberation 101, you’ll learn everything you need to get started on your sexual liberation journey in a safe environment where you can explore who you are (or want to be) as a sexually liberated person—on your own terms.

This isn’t about tips or tricks. With Sexual Liberation 101, you’ll bring focus, awareness, and healing to who you want to be sexually—authentically and gently. And by the end of this course, you'll officially be on your sexual liberation journey.
