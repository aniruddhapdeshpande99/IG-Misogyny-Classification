my sexuality/sensuality has been deeply challenged by the upheavals and personal tragedies of 2020, and if it weren’t for me actively seeking out ways to help my body remember the pleasure that is its birthright, connection to my sexuality wouldn’t be coming naturally right now. I know my sexual self well enough to know that stress kills my desire, it disconnects me from my body, it makes holding space for the erotic within me near impossible. I’ve been on a journey these last few months/weeks to walk a balance between numbing myself from what I’m feeling emotionally and forcing myself physically to be where I’m not. it’s been arduous, but I am finding methods to stay connected and true to myself. I am finding ways to reclaim my body + sexuality from the hands of stress, anxiety, and ungrounding uncertainty of this moment.

also—this is the first sensual selfie I’ve taken in 2020. I used to take photos like this daily but fell off of my practice due to the disconnection I was telling you about. this photo is an example of one of the ways I actively sought out my sexuality/sensuality today despite feeling sad, angry, lonely, and I’m proud. I am grateful I took this moment to myself today because this photo reminds me of the softness I contain and the power I hold within myself. there is nothing quite like having your sensuality be affirmed by your own gaze. I’m grateful to remember.
