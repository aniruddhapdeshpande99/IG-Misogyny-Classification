Women should have the right to choose taking a life and dealing with the mental anguish of having to take a life away that never had the chance to walk, learn to love, learn to drive, learn about loss. Only through this can people learn to take responsibility for their unprotected actions. Consequences when legal would now be, have the kid, give the child up for adoption (cause there are ALOT of people whom are willing to adopt) or abort the life. And one thing the pro-choice never talk about are the mental problems that tend to follow those who do go through abortions.

It is a horrific way to treat women. It also bugs me that even though women were accessing abortion before, the anti-choice people came over from England to campaign against abortion and have set up their own small group here, paying for signs and their body cams.

I would never, ever, be selfish enough to allow mu child to live in constant pain with no quality of life - that is cruel. It is kinder to stop those things from happening. I have personal experience and professional experience of adults in vegetative states and it is unbelievably cruel to allow it to happen. It isn\u2019t a life, it\u2019s an existence.
