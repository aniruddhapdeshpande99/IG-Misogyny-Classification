Just wanted to tell you that the same thing happened to me after my first surgery, a few months later nothing would pass through, cramps, vomiting and all that shit (except there was NO shit \ud83d\ude29) but one surgery later and I was totally fine after that! I relate a lot to your videos about recovery though, a bit of euphoria at first from feeling so much better than before surgery, then from coming home, etc. etc. then came the slow, hard and mentally tough times of having to wait on your body to get stronger. Just, don\u2019t lose too much hope with this set back! You\u2019re not back to square 1 completely as you\u2019ll soon see. Take care gorgeous and thanks for all your videos about life with a stoma!
