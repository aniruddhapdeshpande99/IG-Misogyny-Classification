Practically unheard of! But you decided that you didn't want something in you. You decided to let the IUD be inside your walls and look crooked. You decided that the IUD wasn't for you. As someone with an eating disorder, hormonal contraception wasn't working because if it didn't cause monthly yeast infections or severe boob aches, it caused immense weight gain. My body and my mind couldn't deal with it any longer. Three years of oral contraceptives and I was done. So I finally made the decision to opt for the Paraguard IUD. One month in, however, it was crooked. So they took it out, and three weeks later, put in another one with ultrasound guidance. And then? AND THEN?! I go to have a routine intra-vaginal ultrasound (seven months after the last insertion) and find that it's a lot MORE into my uterine wall. WHY?! Why couldn't you just let me have this? I feel hopeless because the medical world isn't as invested in uterine/vaginal health as we'd like them to be. I feel hopeless because men are the ones who make the decisions for people with uteri. And I feel like I've lost my agency. The only thing left is condoms, and while there are internal condoms that go into your vagina, those are more expensive than penis condoms. Which means, I have to rely on my partner for contraception. (Yes, I realize that I can buy the condoms, but I still have to rely on my penis-wielding partner to put it on and I have to trust them enough to not take it off during intercourse). So, uterus, tell me why you don't want me to be happy. Is it because I told you that I never want children? Are you angry at me for that? Are you angry I've rendered you essentially useless? Does that mean you never want me to have pleasure in my life without a small voice in the back of my head always panicking that this is the moment that I get pregnant? Uterus, I know you probably don't understand. Neither do I. But I wish we could help each other instead of being angry. I wish the world were different. I wish there were more options.

PE class was a struggle as their was a 50:50 chance on how well I could perform. Yeah, I really didn't like you. I went on the pill when I met the love of my life 5 years ago so I forgot about you pretty much until today.

After heavy dosages of painkillers, lasting almost a month and being taken off the pill, I was never given an explanation, justification or cause to what had happened. They simply said 'you are okay and that's all that matters now'. Now in late September of 2018 I have been seen four different nurses, a gastroenterologist (to see if the pill affected my stomach lining) and three gynaecologist of which all said they do not feel confident in giving me any controception due to the way my body reacted last time.
