Peoples lives are so much different from the next, especially across different CULTURES....With shit loads of TRIGGERS & mixed messages coming from multiple directions. It's so sad this situation has occurred & I hope yaz can find some empathy & compassion for each other to evolve & grow through this to the next level \u270c\ud83c\udffc\ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffe\u270a\ud83c\udfff", "cosmic_garden_": "Sending love and support sweet sister \ud83d\udc95", "kimraluna": "@blackwomencry", "completelytogether": "Other box fans lol wtf", "the.vshop": "Where can I find their latest response?!", "_allteenoshade": "Has anything gotten better"}
