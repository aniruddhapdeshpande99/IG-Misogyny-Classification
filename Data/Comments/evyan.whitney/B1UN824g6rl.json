Complete with the love and respect and heartbreak that was part of your WF experience. I appreciate and see your humanity through all of this. Especially BECAUSE of that central your and all of y\u2019all\u2019s experience shedding light for folks on the everyday black femme experience - personally, professionally, collectively. My collective wound has been very tender with the stories y\u2019all shared and my auto-reaction of sadness, anger, and bitter recognition that the same old shit just evolves. I love you. I see you.

Please understand though that just because some \"white people\" out there are assholes and full of hate doesn't mean that we are all that way. It makes me sick to think that it's 2019 and racism is still even a thing. It breaks my heart to be honest and makes me feel disgusted to even call myself human. There are still a few of us in the world that have respect for others no matter what the color of their skin is and believe in love not hate. I am one of those few people and saddens me deeply that so many of you have only ever had shitty experiences with the \"wf\". I hope things get better for you and that you find comfort in knowing that God has better things in store for you and has your back.

Prior to that article, I had been closely following WF and was SO close to purchasing from them. Initially, I was hopeful and confident that they would promptly and proactively come back to take accountability and do whatever it took to rectify their actions as much as possible. As time and their silence continued, my faith in them began to dwindle. Once their incredibly defensive article was posted, I just couldn't maintain my respect for them or their company anymore. They had a chance to be role models for white people, and all people; an opportunity to show what anti-racism and emotional intelligence REALLY looks like. They couldn't show up for that and it breaks my heart that you and the other people they have deeply harmed have been affected this way. I want you to know that you have my attention and I am excited to start exploring the work you do to support you.
