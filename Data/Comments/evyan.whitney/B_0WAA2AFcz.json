{"barbarabailando": "Where do I start... the word \u201cdecolonization\u201d says it all. I thought I needed sex ed because my parents could even talk about periods, never mind anything having to do with sex - or even saying the word itself. In my late 20s I finally walked away from hardline evangelicalism after years of experiencing spiritual, sexual, and other types of trauma. In the ensuing years I realized that what I really needed was sex ed that reframed my ENTIRE FUCKING WORLDVIEW. Coming to terms with my sex nature, my body, my own desires, my history, my hurt, my physiological trauma responses... that is the sex education I need and that I\u2019m pursuing. I\u2019m finding that the freedom that comes from the healing is what has unleashed my wildest, most sensual, most sending self. Tips and tricks, that\u2019s all well and good.
