After a childhood experience it was ingrained in me that pleasure is shameful, and even after doing some things out of a natural desire/search for pleasure (reading and writing erotica, having sex, getting a toy...) there's always a shame subtext. I know I'm very sexual but feel kinda trapped somehow. I've been told -by an expert- my second chakra is blocked, tho I don't know much about those things, and also that my hip/waist area feels blocked and without energy. I think this manifests -among other things- in an inability to do the girl on top position -my hips feel somehow weak and lost and i get anxious- and my inability to dance -which is a big source of shame for me, not being able to do something everyone does, when I try I get anxious and feel stiff af-. It's like a mental and physical stiffness I've always felt specially regarding sexuality and sensuality.
