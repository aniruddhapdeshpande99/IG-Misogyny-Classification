The only thing they won't allow there is kiddie porn and snuff. It's open source, so anyone can go into the backend and see what they're up to or even contribute some code. No secret algorythms, no databases vaulting private info. DMs have end to end encryption. fb and insta get all the ad revenue their users generate and even charge you extra to boost your posts.
