In some ways I feel that working so closely with sexual discourse and the complicated bundle that is the psychology of sex makes me more likely to shut down and experience periods of sexual \"hibernation.\" Sometimes it feels like others are reaping all of the benefits of me bringing up and unpacking taboos and stigmas around me while I am left drained and the furthest thing from turned on.
