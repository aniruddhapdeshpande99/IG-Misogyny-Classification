Thank you!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb May I ask you an important question? Why, in your opinion do you think it\u2019s so important for women to reclaim their sensuality? And take in their space?

If you joined the challenge on or after 9/5, you will not receive the prompts that were published before you joined. That\u2019s because the challenge is live and I am unable to resend . You will receive the next prompts bright and early tomorrow morning\u2014around 3:00am PST.  2. If you want to do the prompts you missed, please look through our hashtag: #sensualselfiechallenge. There are clues about what the prompts are in people\u2019s captions.  3. This challenge has grown much bigger than I intended/imagined; there are literally 2,500+ of you taking it right now\u2014which is incredible but also very overwhelming for a highly sensitive empath like me. During the last challenge, I was able to view and like/comment on almost every post. This time that would be next to impossible. But know that even if I\u2019m not commenting/liking, I am seeing every single photo you are putting out and doing my best not to cry my eyes out because you\u2019re so beautiful. 4. Lastly, I just want to mention that there\u2019s no team helping me manage this challenge\u2014no assistants or customer service folks or even interns. It\u2019s just me and my little laptop. I mention this so that you know understand how challenging it is for me to respond to each message and question right now, specifically because I have other work/projects that needs my attention\u2014my clients specifically. So if you\u2019ve got a question, please be patient with me as it might take a moment before I respond. And if you do have a question, please don\u2019t DM me, send me an email (link in bio). I love you.
