I'm not pro BJP, I'm a neutral Indian citizen wanting my country to shine out on the globe because it's something many generations have longed for. The social media only picked up its pace in the recent years but the real issues like Poverty, Corruption, Unemployment, Scams have been going on for 70 years. As much as I hate to see Muslims being lynched, I also hate kashmiri pandits being hurt. We say that look at the MP and vote but do we realize that we would still need a PM to lead the country. All these years Congress kept fucking up this nation, 70 years later Rahul Gandhi still talks about removing poverty when that should have been done long ago while his older generations were ruling the nation. We brought Modi for change and now when it's happening its making us all uncomfortable. We talk about \"change\" all the time but we forget that change is the basis of growth. All the fuck ups that BJP did wouldn't have taken place had the nation not have been fucked up so badly in the past. Demonetisation wouldn't have been needed if the black money didn't exist in the first place.

If you will look dig the surface you'll realize what kind of change is actually needed.
