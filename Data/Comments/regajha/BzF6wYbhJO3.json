Periods are considered far from normal in our society, as you know, because our society just doesn't comprise of the urban people like you and me. I come from U.P., and so many friends of mine who come from educated families are still not allowed to enter the kitchen when they are on their period. It's stigmatized to that extent. Hence it becomes important to not just create awareness by talking about it, but by showing it and getting graphic. We want the world to see it's just blood, and not a taboo. I really think if you get uncomfortable by two drops of blood, then you should increase your threshold a bit. Moreover, everyone has a right to express whatever they want in whatever form, and I believe comments like yours will only further discourage people from coming out and being open about these things. And believe me, we need to be open about it, especially in India. Please be a bit more sensitive before you comment next time. If you still don't understand what I or others mean, I at least request you to not bother others by leaving such comments and just let them be. :)", "sanjanaa_babu": "\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f", "van44_": "\u2764\ufe0f", "ojohhey": "YES", "the_baalika": "Cheers \ud83e\udd42", "iamjagritip134": "\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "mohdrehankhan": "You are fucking crazy....
