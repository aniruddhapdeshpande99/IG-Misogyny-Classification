Other is this extremely well dressed, make up and hair on point, bag, shoes, belt coordinated so called perfect self. People often call the second one fake and made up. I have been makeup shamed so many times. But nothing gives me that crazy confidence than a loud mouth.

We\u2019re used to using words like \u201canxiety\u201d and phrases like \u201cmy brain is being unkind to me.\u201d But I wonder if the acknowledgement of or various selves can offer new forms of expression in order for us to understand situations (and our whole selves) better.  For instance, we can say that sometimes our \u201chigher selves\u201d get frustrated with the basic-ass shit that our \u201cnormal selves\u201d wind up doing over and over again. Or the way our \u201cshadow self\u201d takes control and makes choices out of fear, making us smaller and more constricted\u2014pissing off the higher self and creating a tug of war within us that make us fidgety, unsure, doubtful and... anxious. Know what I mean jelly-bean? Accepting our inner team of selves and making space for all of them to work together and get along is crucial then.
