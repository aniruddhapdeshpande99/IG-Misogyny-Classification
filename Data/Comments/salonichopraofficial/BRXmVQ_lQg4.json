I have read many of your posts and all I always read is that you always blame men and blame them for everything. U say that men use women only for their body so that they can explore and enjoy and fulfil their fantasies. I mean who have u dated ? I highly doubt all that u say had any single thing ever happened with u ?? Have u ever been a sex object to any man. Had u ever been through any of this. I guess never and still u make such bold statements just on some assumptions. We respect a women equally. We know how to love and care too. There may be some men who take women like u say but then there r also women in our society that use men just for money and a luxury life. There r some women who use men for their pleasure and then just betray them when they find something better. I am not blaming women or disrespecting them. Just want to say that all types of ppl exist in our society. U talk about women wanting to liberal and want that they should not be judged by their clothes and freedom of being top**** but a little spoiler alert for u , women are equally responsible and they equally judge another women for their clothes. Wear a short skirt and revealing top and just pass through some aunties or some mature women. U will be equally judged and shamed. U even sometime get comments on such posts by u from a women itself. But u never blame them. So don't just blame men for everything. We know how to respect women very well and expect same respect from a women too. We work equally shoulder to shoulder with a women now and all u think that men just look towards a women with lust. Pls come out of the so called 19th century u r living in. Pls come out of this never ending saga of u blaming men all the time. If we check out a girl that we are equally checked out and stated by a girl too but we don't make an issue. Nobody is expecting u to walk between bedrooms and kitchen, we can also swap this and walk between bedrooms and kitchens and let women go out and work but then u women will be the first one to shame the guy for making his wife work and himself sitting at home.

I am a blogger myself and have been following and read your blog posts religiously and closely. And I truly respect you voicing out your thoughts such as this one on a social media out loud- there's no doubt that we all want to be heard after all what's the point of being a human if we can't express what we repress inside. I know we live in a nation where eve-teasing and letching have become a way of life for huge percentage of men (sorry I can't approximate the figure here but I suppose a huge number of men) but I guess you must be aware of the small percentage of men who actually appreciate everything about women-their wants, needs, desire, celebrate their success and will always be by their side no matter what; we always forget to write about them, we never celebrate such men as if they don't exist and even if they do we invariably tend to shift our focus on men who really don't. I know we bloggers write from our experiences hence this post but I have a feeling you must have encountered and met men I wrote about. Why don't you for a change write about them. By the way none of what I said means that I don't agree with you I completely do but what I mean is consistently writing about bad experiences give too much way to them and shut doors on the good ones.
