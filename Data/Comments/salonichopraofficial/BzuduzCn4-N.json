I afraid young girls will have a bad influence... Let's be a team and teach a lesson... No need of such hypocrisy... Fake people should be blocked... She just click controversial pics in luxury hotels, her poor acting couldn't earn her a successful career so she chose this method of earning fame... I am feminist too. And I know so many women who are so strong and struggling for female rights in real life and guess what? Without talking about ' nipples' and 'tits' . This should be made clear on social media if you talk about 'do whatever you want' then be ready coz there will be an outcome, people don't like you will block you and report you... Spreading unnecessary controversial messages and not understanding real feminism, just showing off will not be accepted anymore... A wise person will not tolerate wrong things...
