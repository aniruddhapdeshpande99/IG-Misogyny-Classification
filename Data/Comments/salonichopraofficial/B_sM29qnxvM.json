Scared because I'm too old to make my body feel nothing and scared because I don't know how to tell my ravaged sexual brain to chill if he likes a woman or a man in all their beauty. I'm still weeping, thinking that how probably I will never be able to love anyone after I have known the reasons of the ravage. Oh, how I want to stay away from any kind of relationship where there is a gender of my orientation involved. I will remember your post because I hate myself too much. And someday probably I will be able to love someone who I would not want to possess, not want to hide and not feel misunderstood. I pray to God that she or he gives us more women like you and more men like your lover. And less like me who can understand their instincts but don't realize that those instincts have also been engineered. I wanted to send you this on your message box but I'm writing it in the open forum because I believe I'm not the only one who fights himself the same way and they should hold on a little more.

THAT GUY CAN BE BOUNDED WITH SOCIETY TOO. HE KNOWS HOW MEN LOOKS AND OBJECTIFY WOMAN. HE DOES NOT WANT HIS GIRL TO BE LOOKED WITH EVIL EYES. The government here does not allow that. I'm not saying the women should not have any sort of freedom,but I'd request you to please not bluff them with your celebrity freedom applied on all sections of the society. That beach might have that culture to roam around naked and honestly, yes every woman wants to have that kind of freedom atleast once in a lifetime or they wish to have that. But we here in india are not habitual of that culture. You as a celebrity can do anything you want or post anything, your family might be supporting you, you might belong to the upper section of the society. NOT EVERY GIRL CAN. Plus, India is renowned worldwide for it's culture and ethics, if we all here will adapt all sorts of this Barcelona culture, just imagine how that might end up in. I'm a girl coming from a middle class background, what you have your thoughts, I've had all this since I hit my puberty, unfortunately I thought I can live like a girl in Europe or foreign countries in India, Uttar Prdesh, Ghaziabad. Ended up getting harassed and loaded with heavy arguments from society and family. What I feel is it's great to have freedom of choice to what to wear and when. But a girl should know to dress up according to the environment. If I'd wear shorts and mini dresses when visiting my village or lower areas like that, it's obvious I'll be objectified. I cannot expect men their to not to look at me. Whereas when I'm in a function with some high mentality people, I'd wear dresses whatever I want to and my family will accept. It's not always about feminism and equality.
