Coming to the point where you want to fight for the freedom of not wearing bra's as a matter of fact not wearing anything at the top, calling it freedom, let me tell you something, some things are meant to be this way, Talking on a broader perspective, animals (humans come under this) especially females have some tricks under their sleeves or a body part which attracts male and there's as reason to it , reproduction ! Taking the species forward ,protecting it. It is that in humans we hide that body part so that we don't run on continuous reproduction cycle. An animal goes on to reproduce from its maturity age till he is maybe old because he's not able to find females (They are for dominant). But humans are intelligent species so they have other things to do than reproduce. Now coming to the point of rapes, they usually happen when your things are exposed, exposing or showing that fancy thing means a yes for sex in animals. Go check all the insects when the females shows their part she means she's ready to have sex. Which is why the society suggests to wear proper clothes so that your don't end up misunderstood.
