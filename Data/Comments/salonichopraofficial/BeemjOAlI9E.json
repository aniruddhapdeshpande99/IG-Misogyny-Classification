Female body parts are always objectified. Skirts above the knees make people stare us more, an extra undone button makes men (not all but the ones who does) peep them inside as if they will enter the shirts. Why? Is it so bad or is it an invitation? Isn't it just a normal body part that is sometimes revealed unintentionally. Large breasts aren't any girls choice neither is a smaller one, still some jerks look at them as if they are some sort of a television show that is made to be looked at. She feels that it is not her body that is wrong it's people who are wrong. Not a single guy feels unsafe wearing shorts or just a vest. Bodies are so much normal than what people usually think.

But the way you related emotions of women to men's bare chested photos is contrary to the men emotions to women bare chest . You can see that men and women have different body structures , different voices , different sexual organs , so why not there can be different emotions towards bare chest of their opposite . Maybe these emotions are nature gifted that cannot be changed . I think it's okay for a men to get aroused by bare chested women . Also it's okay for women to be bare chested if she wants . It's very basic nature of men to stare at the women they find attractive. Some stare for a nanosecond , some do it until they are stared back and some shamelessly cross their limits . It depends on way they are raised. Even a cold fact is that more than half of your male followers on Instagram are here not crave your good and independent thoughts but something else .This is not an educated guess but a guess that men can understand.
