Still have a question? Ask your own! What is your question? 6 ANSWERS Esha Parvathi, Tinker Tailor Lawyer Spy Answered Jan 4 2015 \u00b7 Author has 1k answers and 2.1m answer views Feminism is the belief that women should have the same rights and access to resources as men. Example: Autonomy of Being. The idea is that both genders are free human beings and no one has the right to trade ownership of humans for compensation. A feminist believes that women should be free. No one has a right to sell her body, nor the right to force her to give services.  Situation:  A family needs money. A 13 year olf girl is pulled from school and forced to marry a man in exchange for 2 bags of potato and a goat. A feminist says: Hey, I think this girl has a choice in deciding whom she marries. It is immoral to sell her to a man. Chauvenists think: Women were a lot happier when sold as chattel. Nowadays, men must wait until the girl is 18 and they actually have to have a personality. Marriage is not so easy as going to the market to buy two bags of potatoes and a goat.  This is unfair and it discriminates against men. Where is our right to buy a woman for 2 bags of potatoes and a goat. See the difference? All have to say.
