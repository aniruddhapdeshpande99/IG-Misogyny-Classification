The persistent annoying skin lightening cream or fat burning scheme just light up our insecurities, things we are always trying to cloak behind some invisible veil. But that what makes us, us. All those imperfections, moles, darkspots, hair at wrong places, this makes us 'us'. What we do get to chose is how we love those folds, those tiny black territories, our dark side, we do get to chose the way we deal with 'parlour wali Aunty's neverending criticism', we do get to chose the love we want for us, and if we are not able to love our flaws, why are we seeking the same from others.
