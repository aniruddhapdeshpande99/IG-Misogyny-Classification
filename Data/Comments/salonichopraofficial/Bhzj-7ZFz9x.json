The concept of consent in a marriage did not exist, the concept of satisfying a woman did not exist. Not in their times at least. She is scared of sex and doesn't even know what an orgasm is because sex was never consensual. It was always about the men. And it has been for ages. Even today in the village women don't enjoy sex, they are not asked if they want it or not. Their husband just rip their clothes off and, sorry for this but that's how it is, stick their damn dicks in their vagina. They don't care if it hurts the woman or if she's ready for it or not. Nope, they want sex and they will force their penises down their wives throats. No one cares about what the woman wants and no one asks either. How would you feel if you weren't asked if you want to have sex or not? These women aren't asked. If doesn't matter if they're sick or if they're bleeding and most of the times these men don't even use a condom and these women not only get raped but they also give birth to their rapists child and then get god knows how many abortions because these men do not want to use a condom.

In any rape the victim is not considered a human being. And the person who doesn't consider another as a human being doesn't have humanity left in them.

All policies have been made by men, mostly favouring men, and some, out of humanitarian consideration, for women (say banning sati). In today's world we still have women without social support and economic strength but we have powerful women too. And a law providing specificallyfor marital rape would do a lot of good to every woman but especially to those who have less social security. But, the concept of consent is very delicate within the framework of marriage. It is not unusual to assume physical intimacy is subject to a standing consent - always present. The key factor is whether one is forcing the other or manipulating otherwise. Things can be a bit difficult to prove for both the parties - whether alleging or denying. A law is needed for protection but it must be kept in mind that no gender should be more privileged than the other - equality must be the requirement. Having no law is not good but having a law that can be used to tarnish the image and life of someone who is innocent is not a better idea. So the law needs to be framed in a way that protection of one party should not make an innocent party worse of. The law should not put men under a preconceived suspicion.

Most men fail to understand this, they usually use the tagline 'I'm your husband and you are mine, don't I have this right over you?'.

But the way you handle everything truly inspires me, i wish i could be as strong as you. Coming to this cause, once again i completely support what you feel. Marriage is a decision two people take together, that principle doesn't just end after you've completed your rituals.
