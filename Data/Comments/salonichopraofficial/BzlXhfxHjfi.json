Feminism is about women's choice, so if I feel lazy or don't have the time to shave it's my choice, to have hairy underarms. She trying to say that women or men should not be shamed for that choice. They should have the choice to choose whatever they feel comfortable with. It's not about her showing hair or not. It's about her choosing to show it, to not shave because it's her body and she can choose to shave it or not. If she chooses not to then we have to respect that choice, we might not like it and think it's gross but we have no right to shame her for that, we have to respect her choice. If we don't like it we should keep our opinion to ourselves. Feminism is about making people respecting women's choices, for underarm hair or other things.
