Compare to all other body parts boobs are indeed attractive and beauty of women is from her boobs only. Nipples stimulus men. You can go and check not against this picture but just saying. Somewhere I don't agree with you about nudity of boobs. Because scientifically boobs has its charm and why to kill that charm and go against Nature. Wearing whatever you like and nudity of boobs is totally different. And literally you're promoting west culture it's your choice agree but you have such a amazing source to promote your own country culture sometimes you can do it for sure. And yea you're kind rude towards people . You don't agree even if someone talks scientifically just because you want to show boobs you mock it to everybody face there is a certain way to represent yourself and caption too respecting ig terms and condition too it's not like I'll do wtf I want because of some reason they have such terms and conditions we have kids too. And yea if women started roaming kids be like ohh nice boobs Mumma.. cool , choices, are ok but in our society we have some relations with our cousin's parents etc. No matter how much I'm modern but ya I can't go without top in front of my dad . It's not a mindset it's about respect. Boobs are attractive and it's totally different from men chest. @abigail_pande even she do nude shoot for yoga but she has a proper caption and a proper nude she don't go against IG community because she knows things very well we have kids too and she is not like I'll do wtf I want. She always cover her boobs in nudes too because a sensible person will know that it arouses definitely and even she mention in caption I hope I don't arouse in a way and always think before posting sexual content that's call politeness you have to think it's not everytime I'll do wtf I want but ya that doesn't mean you have to rape or not.
