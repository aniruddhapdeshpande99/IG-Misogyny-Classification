You'll never hear a woman in an African tribe was raped because she was naked. All of the people are naked. We're born that way , the clothes purpose was to provide warmth in the cold and a sense of fashion as we evolved. You all religious cunts in the name of religion and beauty and grace twisted everything to suit your needs , to suppress women and even some men because you sure as hell knew that they would come out stronger than you. Just to gain power , you all stereotyped women being graceful if covered from head to toe. People, all the rapist fucks are worse than animals. Even animals try to win the female , not go ahead and rape them. You all neither understand the concept of consent and clothes. Let me let the truth out. You all are no fucking saints. The reason you rape is because the way you've grown up , seeing the society the way it is , issues made out of fucking breasts, you think they're too big of a deal but they're just parts of the body. All those oppressed physical and emotional stress of not getting laid drives you crazy and you cannot fucking control your own self. So you all rape , because you sure as hell know that with the mindset you have , no girl would willingly get laid with you. The reason why a little part of her nipple out is such a big deal to you is because it's unusual to you. You've never seen it. To you it's slutty to be posting such pictures. It's her choice.
