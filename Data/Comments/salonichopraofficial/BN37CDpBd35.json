So why the hell are you putting up a comparison and shouting 'equality'? Equality is when both the genders are treated as humans with equal rights. Equality involves fighting to get the equal and just rights and uplifting the narrow mentality of the society that women are inferior. It doesn't at all mean that we will hashtag free the nipple as a man and woman's nipple are the same. What kind of way is it to fight for equality man? i feel a body part has nothing to relate with equality.. body has nothing to do with women's rights.

It's easy to call someone names. Women have started working and are not confined to just being \"homemakers\" anymore. They can multi task. This is not the 1950s. We have to change with time. Everyone has a right to their own opinion. But being subjected to old school of thoughts and living like that is a disease. Don't spread it around. If the world was left up to you, women would still be confined to their homes, fully covered with no opinions to voice whatsoever. So stop. Think instead. Try. It won't come naturally to you with so many years of conditioning that you probably have. But give it a shot. Don't choose the easy way out. Freedom is our birth right. What we choose to do with it, depends on us and us only. Don't fault parents who are evolved enough to trust their kids. There is no such thing as \"faltu freedom\".
