Even our holiest book bhagwad Gita doesn't have a single topic on how should we be dressed. Then I really wonder who the hell made dress codes, dress ethics, dressing etiquettes and constricted them for women only? And the most horrible thing our dress decodes our virginity status. Its true. A little ago I overheard a group of girl chatting about a girl who wore crops to our class. They were like \"oh my God! Is she trying to seduce the teachers, \" and guess what it was only a crop top with no waistline visible not a bikini. And that girl suddenly became a wise girl to a slut. Just one crop to class. I feel very happy when I see many strong women like you @redheadwayfarer taking so many strives for making us feel we are the universe , nothing can set our limits.
