But I'll reiterate my point, and if someone reads this, and later \"magically\" sees the message disappear, you know what happened, again. As mentioned, this post only highlights how women fighting for \"wearing less/none\" is empowering, and must be fought for. Ignoring the dangers, calamities, racial discrimination and official banning by many countries to wear certain clothing, such as hijab, niqab, turbans, and many more. People wearing \"more than societal norm\" or different, are looked upon with suspicion, isolated, interrogated for no reason, and disqualified from employment. How humiliating is it to live that way everyday, where is the empowerment and equal rights to \"wear\" things people believe in? but no, people don't \"choose\" to wear these things, they're probably told to, or oppressed to, they don't need empowerment. It is only empowering when you rebel against society to \"show it all\". While there are actual laws being made in the world to ban women from wearing certain attire of their choice. But go ahead, talk about the intense trauma people in the 1st world go through of not being able to show their bra in public.

Be so strong that men don't even dare to suppress women! and what about women suppressing women?! I have seen women suppressing women much more than men suppressing women! Personally I have met several girls who say they don't want to be friends with girls as they're not as trustworthy as boys! But I haven't met a single guy in my life who says that men aren't as trustworthy as women and therefore he doesn't want to be friends with men! The entire feminism issue is one sided and without any proper definition."}
