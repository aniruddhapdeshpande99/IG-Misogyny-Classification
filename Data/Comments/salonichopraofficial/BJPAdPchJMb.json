Ur thoughts r gr8. Respect Respect Respect........ Somewhere I get confused while reading them, u r inspiring girls or u r motivating them to fight against men or u r teaching them not to tolerate any act which is harassing them. There r many angles to it, few r good for mankind but the way u portrayed it, I think this thing needs correction. What ever we learn is mostly inspired or influenced or depends on our upbringing. You, being youth icon can teach all girls and boys that, when they will have kids they should teach them in such a way that their kids wud never act as the ppl u find disgusting or harassing or limiting girls for unnecessary traditional values. As we all know the fact that kids specially boys r more attached to mother I say here that every mother and father should motivate n teach kids to respect women. As a mother being women can easily teach her son to respect women in his whole life and same teaching should need to be given to girls too. There r many different types of cases in India where women r only responsible for harassing another women. They kill their girl child for so called \"vansh ka varis\". It is not about sexuality or gender, it is not about what u r wearing, it is not about virginity. Real fight is against mentality and upbringing. I know women are being harassed and tortured but the way u portrayed it is not the way it should be, it will motivate them to hate men. Rather we all should get together and fight for it as a Person and not as a male or female. I liked the way u boldly inspire women to flight, but I would love it if u inspire both boys and girls to fight for it as a person.
