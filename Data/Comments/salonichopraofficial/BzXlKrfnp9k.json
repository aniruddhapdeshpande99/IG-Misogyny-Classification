That is not about men vs women, that is more about Shraddha and ttradition of the place. If it were to be anti-women, temples wouldn't be allowing any woman to enter a temple on any day just because they are women. Which is not the case. I will give you an example to give a different perspective: - In Kerala most of the temples require men to remove their shirt/kurta/top before entering. It is a tradition. Men might feel bad about it as many Indian men have unpresentable bodies and many are even shy. But if they are at a temple, they are there because of Shraddha and share their pain/happiness/request/thanks, and not for demanding equality or rights or ego-ride.", "raghavendra072": "You are amazing \ud83d\udc4cso beautiful in pink \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d", "dx9974": "ok", "laxman_k33": "\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude0d", "abdulqadeerkhanthaheem": "Ur teasing me by these pictures uffffff", "saumtastic": "1. Men can walk around bare chested showing their \u2018n*****s\u2019 as and when they feel like without bothering whether women feel uncomfortable, but if a woman does the same it is considered nudity or sexualised and suddenly all men feel uncomfortable. 2. The reason female nudity has become such an issue is because of having considered the female body like something alien. We worship female goddess in all forms but the one thing that feeds our children is considered vulgar. 3. Many a times women in sarees show most of their back, breasts and stomach and yet it isint considered vulgar because that clothing is a part of our \u2018culture\u2019. However so it still has a lot of skin show. 4. She has the most supportive man in her life (not that I feel she needs his validation) who has let her be the way she wants. Sadly even today many women don\u2019t even have the right to smile openly let alone even fulfil their smallest wishes. 5. What she does with her body or how she decides to show it is her and her \u201cCHOICE\u201d only and nobody can have a say it that. 6.

I mean I'm a girl, love to wear various dresses but is feminism just means showing skin or exposing our nudity?? I truely agree by your caption but exactly that's where the point lies... We girls need to rise more in the grounds of education first to acquire and fight for our equal rights that have been given to the men and we are being deprived of.. It's one's personal choice how much skin they want to show, but always posting about feminism with exposing skin feels like feminism is primarily about our nudity... And then comes all the things.. Is it so??? Ofcourse not everyone goes through the captions to know what you wrote.... Honestly I really don't understand this thing... This link of constant showing skin with the women development... Also I don't think if people would love to roam around without wearing clothes.. If that would have been the case, clothes would not have been ever invented... And also There are many profiles i have seen posting such pictures just as an art, photography, beauty or something like that .. That's also okay.. All good...
