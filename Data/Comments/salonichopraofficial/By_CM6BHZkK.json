But this time i felt to convey my deepest gratitude of being one of the silver linings we have in the times when we see scores of women and men belittling and trampling the word Feminism. Most people probably see you as a radical feminist. But for me being radical doesn't necessarily means the one who has the raw courage of speaking the uncomfortably starch truths everytime, like you do. Feminism is an evolving ideology and a social process. Developed societies nowadays are talking about right to one's body (abortion), breast feeding etc. These liberties have already been under the domain of many societies, especially India. But here the right to one's body comes down to issues of sexual abuse, domestic abuse, moral policing, objectification and everyday sexism. It is a highly polarized issue which is interdimensional to many issues in the society, like economic strata, racism, casteism, religion etc. So we need to understand feminism may mean different for different people. But the basic underlying assumption is the liberty to choose to exist in one's own healthy space so as no one suffers from the toxic patriarchy. But the change will be gradual. It will take time. Societal institutions and ideology need to evolve and restructure through their own necessitated duration of time. But people like you are needed to highlight the backwardness of the process and the situation. Keep doing the excellent work. This stuff is way ahead of its times for the ignorant masses.
