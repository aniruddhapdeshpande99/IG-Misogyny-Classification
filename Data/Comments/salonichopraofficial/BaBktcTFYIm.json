We really need a law about it but @redheadwayfarer it's not like the legal system is doing nothing about it. They've been looking for making a law which cannot be misused like the rape laws. There are 53% false rape cases and some people are misusing the law which is totally wrong. They know the consequences of making marital rape law at this point because to verify and check if it is actually marital rape or false accusation is very difficult. A lot of discussion about this is happening and the legal system is trying to come up with ways which won't lead to damage for an innocent person. Also another thing , we cannot deny that recently the judiciary system has made many laws which are for the upliftment and empowerment of women. Many laws in India empower women , and it's high time that women start taking stand for themselves. Till the time the law is not made for marital rape they themselves should get up and take a stand for it. As a law student I can tell you that mere laws won't help , Because already their are thousands of laws which are not even used. It's the mindset of people that needs to be changed more than the laws.", "mr_vasu07dz": "https://www.instagram.com/payu__15/", "khush25.m": "@redheadwayfarer You are a blessing to our society, that needs to reach out to all.
