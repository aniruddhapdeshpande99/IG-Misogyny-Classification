Your courage has inspired many victims to speak out and stand up for themselves against the predators ready to prey upon. What you have done is absolutely phenomenal. But I disagree with you here. I think it's naive to observe that men and women are equal in all aspects and therefore women shall have the legitimacy to do everything as you have pointed out about revealing nipples. To put things in perspective we consider women breast as something to do with sexuality and so do penis and vagina unlike mens' chest/nipples. Slight visual of it might arouse men. I think it's too stubborn to show your nipple simply because men do. Just because men and women have equal rights, opportunities, responsibilities etc. may not necessarily mean the absolute parity. Obviously there's widespread gender discrimination in our country such as foeticide, infanticide, rape, domestic violence against women, dowry system and so on and thats our immediate concerns that need to be dealt with sever punishment. But what if some sort of strict laws being made to ensure that women and men or lgbt community shall have the same number of representatives or labourers in factories, defense, jail guard, contruction, mining or any hazardous working environment which is unlikely suitable for women? Do you think equality still relevant to this situation? I am 100% with women rights but there are still questions that need deeper introspection. We have rights to express ourselves but laws don't guarantee protection for its consequences. In other words we use our freedom at our own cost.
