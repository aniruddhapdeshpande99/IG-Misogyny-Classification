I'm an older guy (but everything still works very well, thankfully) and I must tell you: you looked so hot in those black leggings and T-shirt at the end of the episode, when you were doing some moves on the pole, and having some really cool booty moves while sitting on the stage. I went to a few strip clubs years ago, but it's just not my thing. With that said, I would go to a strip club if you were there as one of the strippers/pole dancers. And not just because of who you are (although admittedly that is a factor), but more so that I can get an idea of how flexible you would be in bed (with me, in my dreams). You really looked great sliding down that pole your legs wide open, and you swirled around that pole like you'd been doing it for years. One of the best Slutever episodes.
