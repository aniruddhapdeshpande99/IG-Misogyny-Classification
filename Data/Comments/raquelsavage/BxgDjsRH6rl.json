The fact that they are also trying to criminalize birth control as well is so scary for me, I\u2019ve been taking birth control since I was 16 to manage my pcos symptoms.

It's truly a terrifying time right now. I'm not from the US, I'm Brazilian. And seeing how backwards the US is going, only makes me more afraid here, because the (very white, retired-at-33 64 year old) president shows more loyalty to the US (even though Trump doesn't give a shit because we're Latin America, he wants us to rot in hell).

So many of my friends have gotten abortions and it really truly was the right choice. They were not mentally, physically or emotionally ready for a child. And even if they were but just didn\u2019t want to be a mother, they should be able to access abortion! I\u2019m so tired of children being wielded as punishment for a woman\u2019s actions. That alone shows this is not about caring for children because why would you wish that on a child? This is about controlling women\u2019s sexuality, and bodies and if abortion is criminalized, our right to vote, too. Also, this just makes birth even more unsafe, when we already have a crazy maternal death rate.  It\u2019s an incredible power to be able to create human life. I feel men (and women brainwashed by the patriarchy) will stop at nothing to take it from us and use it against us.

Although I\u2019ve never had an abortion, I\u2019ve been raped and I\u2019ve been in foster care. A lot of people are only OK with abortion in cases of rape (when the rapist is found guilty) and that makes my blood boil. I\u2019m pressing charges against my rapist and it has been over 9 months and trial still hasn\u2019t started- even though he got caught in the act and all the evidence is there. If my case- where there is all types of evidence ready to convict him- has taken over 9 months, how can they expect a someone to have an abortion AFTER their rapist is found guilty? If I would have gotten pregnant, I\u2019d already be holding a baby in my arms long before I would have been approved for a legal abortion. Also, while I was in foster care, can you believe I didn\u2019t meet ONE single child who was adopted? I lived with 20 at first, met another like 30, and lived with another 6 in a group home and NONE of those children were ever adopted. Our conditions were not the best, I had to take the city bus for almost 6 hours every day to get to school and back because there was no one to drive me and I couldn\u2019t switch to a school closer to me.
