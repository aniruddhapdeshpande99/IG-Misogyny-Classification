{"bornrxbel": "Support for me. Is asking me how my day is without me having to ask you, plan things, reciprocity is so important. Support for me is listening to me & sympathizing with me when I'm not in my greatest mental state. The little things like telling me you miss me, telling me how much I mean to you.

The one general support trait I need tho is listening and understanding. I need you to listen to me not to say I was wrong or state your opinion but to just listen.

How do you move on past that?", "xoxolaneybunny": "Net pay lol", "nox_solyn": "Support for me personally is being listened to and not judged. When my BPD is fuckin up and I'm feeling suicidal etc, or even if I'm just having an off day, getting hugs is amazing. This is a huge deal for me because I loathe being touched by people generally speaking, I'm only ok with it in a \"romantic\" setting. So friends and family don't touch me cos it makes my skin crawl. But I have a fwb partner now, and so being touched by him feels nice, so for the first time in my life, when I feel like shit I can now get hugs from him and it feels NICE, instead of it feeling horrible, which is what happens when friends/fam do it. So that has been amazing for me. :)", "capribaby___": "I'm late but support to me means trusting that I'm capable enough to control my own life and respecting that rather than arguing everything I do or say because *you* don't understand.

I\u2019ve been struggling with this all my life but this past year it has been even worse. I\u2019m starting to realize that my support isn\u2019t reciprocated and I\u2019m backing away from friendships. I know I have to start speaking up and saying what support looks like to me but what I struggle with is how do I bring that up and state what I need support in if the relationship is so old and we\u2019ve been a certain way for so long?", "kramenitsugua": "For me it\u2019s listening \ud83d\udc42 to my rants after I have taken some time to myself to shout at the moon and/or ocean \ud83c\udf0a.

I\u2019ve heard people say that that is too much to ask, but then I remind myself that if I can be gentle and patient with my anger, perhaps another person can too ;) After ten years of receiving mostly the opposite of this, support for me also means trusting my judgment and opinions on things - therefore, meeting most of my statements with curiosity versus instant skepticism and doubt. After all, if a man ridicules something I love or believe in, what does that say about how he feels about my judgment and decision-making process? Some guys would say that I can\u2019t expect a man to always agree with me, and I totally agree - but for me to feel supported I need a man who says \u201chey, I may not have reached the same conclusion on this topic, but I can totally see how and why you did\u201d.", "msblackawareness": "Ooh, yes\u2014that validation IS so important!

So for me, having people who, even if they don\u2019t agree with me, can genuinely say \u201cYou know, I get how you might think/feel that\u201d is EVERYTHING, because it shores up the self-affirming work I try to do with myself.", "marcela_szw": "Same \ud83d\udc46it\u2019s hard to ask for support.
