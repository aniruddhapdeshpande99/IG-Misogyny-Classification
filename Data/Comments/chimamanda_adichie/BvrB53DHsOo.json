So we don't just misinterpret her intentions or give her words some kind of totalitarian authority which of course she has earned as a woman and a scholar. These days everything is debatable What is decent? By whose standards, in what culture or context? We should be reflexive and conscious of these complexities so we don't end up suffering from what Onoge calls \" crisis of consciousness\".
