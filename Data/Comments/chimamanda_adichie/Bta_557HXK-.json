No moment of sighing. I believed in fairy tales. I believed one day the good old witch will come and turn me into a princess. I planned out how my life will be. Jingle jingle jingle bell. I sighed at the lack of many things I sought. Foolish me I murmured. I am here. Where all animals want to be king. Where the lions prey on others without a moment of regret. Where blood is use for merriment. Where the mighty pen has been replaced by the sword. Where evil ambition mock useful toil. Where one is willing to wound but afraid to strike. Where death is so proud. Where thousand oceans can't wash away greed, lust, evil..... Where the crowns adore the head and trample on the tail. Ohhhhh!!!! I shouted but in head, no voice heard.
