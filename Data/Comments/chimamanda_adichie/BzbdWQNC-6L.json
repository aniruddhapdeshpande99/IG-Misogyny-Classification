Feminism is not all about the sweet speeches we make at international functions, it shouldn\u2019t be about only when questions of equality with the male gender arises, I strongly believe it should focus primarily on defending the defenceless woman. The average Nigerian woman everyone believes does not have anyone to speak for her or with a voice of her own. This Senator has called to question everything aNigerian woman stands for. Now is the time to rise and lend your voice in getting justice for not just the woman in question here, but for every defenceless woman out there. @chimamanda_adichie @abikedabiri @dolapoosinbajo @aishambuhari @rt.hon.femigbajabiamila @femigbaja @profosinbajo @michelleobama @oprah Please you are this woman\u2019s only hope. Nigeria is a country where a Senator is usually above the law...please let this notion be corrected by bringing Senator in question to justice. The three dimensions of Justice must be duly served- Justice to the victim, justice to the accused and justice to the society at large. The video is being given the widest circulation, even up to the United Nations. This Senator must be recalled and made to face the wrath of the law. Our Senators are to defend us and not to violate us. Let every woman speak up and against this shameful and wicked act.
