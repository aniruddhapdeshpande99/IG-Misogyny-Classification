You spoke about @hillaryclinton , made comments about Trump on @bbcnews and their elections that sparked conversations about politics in USA. You were on interviews concerning USA. Now, here we go in 2019 we finally have credible enlightened youth aspirants ex. @yelesho speaking to the people of Nigeria. More youths on their own level of hope are actively mobilizing and atleast speaking to less informed nigerians to convince them that they are important and can impact change, but you, as you always \"try to be patriotic\" support \"made in nigeria\" products or speak for African women, your voice has been so silent.. Not even a comment.. not even an encouragement to the youth.. not even the courage to mention a name or say vote for a candidate.. you don't even need to openly mention a candidate. But speak or write like you always do for USA. I am disappointed and I hope you take my comment seriously because this is easily the feeling of any smart nigerian who loves you or his/her country.. Every enlightened or privileged Nigerian is a potential tool for liberating Nigerians. Don't act like you don't see what's going on in your country.. unless you say you are no longer a Nigerian so your actions don't look hypocritical.. i am not into politics but I've seen now that its part of our lives and we all must all contribute with what little power or influence we have so as to impact positive change in mentality/lives of the people of Nigeria..
