Humanity has been stifled in the life's of boys. Boys were raised with the ideology of masculinity in every situation. Now, i believe boys and girls are humans who should be regarded and treated in the same momentum and expect similar results without expecting more or a special result from the boys. Boys were raised not to be vulnerable, scared or with flaws in all ramifications. irrespective of depression, anger or feelings. Male folks have been looked up to and expected to do more in even situations that cannot be humanly handled. Research has proven beyond doubt one of the reasons men had to steal, is because of the huge expectation the society has placed on them. I hope my mistakes as a man does not make you look at me less of a human. It is one thing to know something intellectually and another to go through it emotionally. Loud thoughts.
