Even though I am physically miles and miles away I am standing there, just behind your relatives and friends, close to you, as a fellow human being, as a woman , at a time of mourning for so many of us. At a time when we physically cannot travel to embrace our loved ones and find comfort in their company, nor offer our children the ritual they need, we need, to process the death of their grandfather. At such a time it is ever more important to use words to connect and unite. Thank you for doing that, always. May your aunt rest in peace. Take care.

I have been checking your page since this pandemic broke out to see that all is well with you.

To say I understand or we understand the paranoia you go through would be to tell a lie. Its not something that can be understood. I can't still understand how our world changed so drastically and doing the things that makes us humans, that mark our \"Nigerianess\" has become like mortal sin. Its sad looking out the window and not seeing people congregated, talking in loud whispers, laughing at God-knows-what. Its hard knowing that I prepared for second semester so bad and yet I'm stuck in my house, waiting, thinking if I'd ever resume school. Automatically, graduation for me has been pushed back and there are many times I feel like crying. And I don't even know the exact reason I'm crying. I don't know if \"staying strong\" matters now but its so necessary. I hope this passes soon. I hope we somehow return back to the lives we left, I hope your husband and daughter are safe all through. The Lord bless you and keep you.
