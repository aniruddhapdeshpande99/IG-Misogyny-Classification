Except that I had an unnamed shoulder issue ( probably fibromyalgia) and you had it in the form of slip disc.. the pain just doesn\u2019t stop by going to doctors, neurologist or chiropractor. I still remember after my therapy sessions how light and comforting I used to feel, as if no pain every existed in my body. They say 98% physical problems are psychosomatic.. I am glad you are better Cz my problem is recurring, specially with what\u2019s happening around the world, it\u2019s a painful time for me. Hope you see light at the end of this all.. love and peace to you \ud83e\udd17", "aaadil1901": "@fatima_jbn", "kartikeya_tutwala": "Thank you so much for sharing this story. I shared it with my parents and how mental health plays such an important part in our lives. Did that because they usually overlook the importance of it. Later into the conversation it turned out that they agreed to consider therapy as an option. And I'm so happy for them. Thank you, again. :)", "gagana_bhat": "I could relate so much \u2764\ufe0f You are a lovely human being \ud83d\ude07", "praxearts": "Thankyou for making this video!
