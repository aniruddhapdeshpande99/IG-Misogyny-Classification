Had me laughing like a retarded seal with the \"cocky dude curve\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Quite a few gems you threw in there. This is the first video I've watched of yours. Looks like I have some catching up to do. Keep this thing going. Why don't you talk about 'charity' and whether people's expectations from celebs in the current situation are right/wrong & about the social responsibilities of public figures in such a situation? Just a thought.", "mlpoijnbbhiiuhb": "Clarity.Acceptance.Genuiness. That's you.
