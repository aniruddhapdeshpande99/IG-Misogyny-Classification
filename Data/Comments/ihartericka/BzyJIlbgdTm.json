If my comment offends you, I am sorry, but I am entitled to my opinion. All these stupid\u2014 and I say stupid bc I consider them stupid\u2014things that I hear about sex/gender is a whole new level of stupidity. Let me tell you this, when I came in America I saw how all my classmates where divorced with 100 stepsisters from one side and 100 stepbrothers on the other side. I learned about people undergoing surgeries from man to women and vice versa, and learned about open relationships where a thousand people have sex with one another, and a lot of other things including this what you have written. What else is left for you guys to invent? How come me, or my sister, or cousins or all the friend and family I have in Croatia never came out with these stuff? I remember my classmates, and family and friend, all parents (maybe one or two divorced) were happily married and still are, we all knew who was a boy and a girl, we didnt have to go naked to get attention, and did not need thresomes to keep a family/relationship happy. As a matter of fact\u2014 because I come from a patriarchal country-I always wanted to be a boy and have power. Not only that\u2014 but I didnt want to experience my period every month. Despite my desire being a boy\u2014 bc of the patriarchal society we live in\u2014 i love being a girl. Since I started to understand, and I was told I am girl I fell in love with the idea of being a girl. So all my friend n family I have in Croatia. Anyway\u2014 keeping in mind the way how you grew up\u2014 I know u dont understand what I am talking about.

So excited to get into the podcast tonight!", "erin.rosecheek.renee": "That kink part though \u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f", "tracycozette": "I speak about this often in the work place in my dept and I know it makes people uncomfortable and even puts me in danger but it is what it is. To stress this to nbpoc is wild in and of itself...their proximity to whiteness and privilege and their inherent antiblackness has them shape shifting when convenient and mammifying Black femmes in the office. Thanks for this battery in my back @ihartericka", "sugaring.brooklyn": "\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc", "lagrossetoile": "I think the last point from all that I have seen is spot on. It's like it absolves is temporarily of guilt- we got told we were wrong, we can admit we were wrong, now we can walk off and say to ourselves my gosh how magnanimous and open am I. I am wondering, with all that I've read, whether a better approach for Black people is exactly what you're saying, just block us and go do the necessary for your people, because honestly I really think we do hang round sucking up stuff like vampires. That said, what I have encountered here has forced me to look beyond my own actions and I can say honestly I am better and less toxic than I was. One of the strongest things I've learnt, which I've enacted in my own work, is to give up my voice to someone who knows, and I am doing this now regularly in other work. Whenever I see white people now talking about racial justice if they themselves are not in harms way I just think fuck off and hand the mic over, and I am also trying to fuck off and get out of the way. I don't normally comment much publicly on your account but the last was dead on.", "issatrae": "a real ass fucking question damn. I have legit get guilty on more than one occasion for getting annoyed by someone\u2019s racist/bigoted/homophobic comments from a white person & not wanting to take the time to educate them. I will give them attitude then later be like \u201cI could\u2019ve taken that opportunity to educate them\u201d. But why is that always on us?", "kristin.is.cool": "Can't wait to read more on the last point! Fetishization is so true.

I feel that way about the theater community right now. So many \"black shows\" are basically struggle porn for white people to engage in a weird white guilt fetish and then leave patting themselves on the back without actually doing any work to dismantle white supremacy. We need to stop making work that asks white people to acknowledge our humanity. Fuck white people, i wanna make work to heal US.", "ms.sativafieldz": "I agree white ppl are into it.", "asa_hndrx": "Ready for the more on this later part !! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe also completely agree with Ebony", "pjbonga.17": "@frankoceansbabymother read this \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "jazzberryjam707": "This is a really amazing topic. I create professional development courses and I really wanted to talk about race in the cannabis industry. Instead of creating an entire course on it, I touch on it in my social responsibility course and point folks to the amazing POC who are doing the work (and doing it with far more grace and skill than I currently possess.)", "b11ackhandside": "WHEW. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe", "mamabear_aj": "edges straight snatched! \ud83d\udc87\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "fammit69": "this is so real. i went to an environmental justice march that i realized upon arriving was by a group run by crackers. tell me why i ended up being put in charge of the whole thing and leading and directing everybody bc these crackers didnt know what they was doing and was happy to put the responsibility of all the leaders there unto me \ud83d\ude44 a random african who just happened to show up \ud83d\ude44. like it almost makes me mad and offended how lazy it was- like nobody checked my qualifications or nothing they just rushed to me and handed me the mics and megaphones and put me in charge \ud83d\ude44", "brown_n_curly": "Wow. Straight up! Also I think that white folks like being called out because because it derails RJ conversations and centers it back on them, their most comfortable spot.", "balicerry": "I hadn\u2019t thought about the way RJ work is capitalized upon by white people in the literal sense.

I feel like white people won't ever start examining racism and white supremacy unless they get tipped off by someone who sees the reality of it, which is usually a black or brown person, so that's why I do that.", "ohitsjusttiffa": "That struck me on a spiritual level.", "the_melanin_mrs": "You are absolutely correct. They definitely get off on us cursing them out in some way shape or form. Also I do agree with the RJ issue and the woman\u2019s March \ud83d\ude11 we won\u2019t talk about that because the March was a joke to begin with but anyway. This is true and another reason why I personally feel that intersectionality will do us POC more harm than good. It\u2019s nothing wrong with intersecting I just feel like...... you get my drift. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude12", "cindyaooo": "wowowowow", "roze_royze": "Yessssssss !!!!", "vamosqueda": "100000000000%", "pot_la": "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd", "king_curtisscottie_saturn": "A real ass question \ud83d\udcaf", "alexaphelece\nVerified": "Verified", "cinephile": "The white kink/fetish for being called out (\u201comg I didn\u2019t knooooow!
