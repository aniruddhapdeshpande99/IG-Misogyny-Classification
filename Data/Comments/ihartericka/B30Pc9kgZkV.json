So what should we call that type of human then????? Because I'm lost. Because the human who can get their periods is different to a person who can't. The person who can get pregnant is different to the person who cant. The 'word' gender is technically in our brain as you mentioned as we had to have a word that categorised those who do and do not get their periods or reproduce. Think of the word 'human' is the category term we use to differentiate humans from Animals or plants 'gender' is the term we use to differentiate the 2 types of humans male or females (there are only 2 types of humans which include the shedding of your lining because 1 can and 1 can not). At the end of the day you can't put feathers on a dog and call it a chicken. They will always be different. To think going under the knife to add or remove something changes what type of 'human' you are is nonsense. Identify as you will but you can only ever be 1 or the other. So on the tampon packet instead of male or female lets put \"does\" because lets be honest one does and does not need it. Let's change mr and Mrs to can and can't.

Ignorant folks who are in NO WAY educated about sexology, biology, physiology, psychiatry, etc. love to come on to an educated person page and dig their heels in about what they actually don't understand or made any attempt to learn. That's called stupidity. Stay ignorant if you don't understand or refuse to learn and take it else where. Some folks don't want to be stupid. \ud83e\udd17", "bethserafina777": "\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25", "landofinkandgraphite": "I see some of y'all are really letting the point of this one go right over your heads (and refusing to google the terms nonbinary and transgender,,,)", "bi__cyclist": "@periodmovement", "misterlucian": "It was the merciless gendering of periods that made me hate mine, not the physical experience!", "tazzylamb": "@piersmorgan", "m13ren12": "@lastdaughterofkrypton", "kieranblake": "Just telling my 4 y o that any gender can have a baby.
