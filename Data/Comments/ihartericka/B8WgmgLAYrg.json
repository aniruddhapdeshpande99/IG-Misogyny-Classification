{"bleueskies": "@ihartericka I feel so sad reading how deeply you seem to delight in engaging the bitterness and separateness you feel toward people who dont have the same outward skintone as you. You are an exemplary leader in so many ways and usually seem awesomely adept at asserting your personal resentmentments or frustrations in ways that are still compassionately playful and openhearted around the edges and invite healing and understanding, but in this post and thruout this thread you seem to be enjoying and supporting an open freeforall equating all people of light/white/whatever you enjoy jokingly calling it skin color with being a representative persecutor and agent of harm toward you and all people who have a skin color like you. And its simply not true. I understand the generations old trauma and the fucked up history and persisting tragedies that contribute to you feeling this way but i wish and hope you will find it in your heart to realize or remember that almost everyone in the world is suffering because of the terrors that have been created here, everyone in all their gazillion different selves and feelings and experiences of being human and trying to navigate the absurd difficulties of being alive, with and without complex intertwining trauma-laden histories- Everyone is suffering. And these sufferings will not go away by wrenching and cutting and raucously jesting greater divides between us all. Laughter and humor is good medicine, of course, but I urge you to reflect more deeply on the roots of your feelings and the ways that your personal and communally shared struggles have embittered you from understanding others experiences as potentially just as strugglesome as yours. I hope you will find constructive and creative ways to rebel against and help reform the social systems and psychological patterns that have hurt you. I hope that in the future you will have more unexpected experiences of connection and understanding with people who you at first judge and project upon, so that you can learn and feel more willingness to express and engage your persisting feelings in more careful ways that will help you and everyone to heal.", "michaelparsell": "We\u2019re actually pink. \u2665\ufe0f", "blackmaternalhealthfair": "\ud83e\udd23", "mackdaddythecutieplugg": "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "airxsiren": "traumavores\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "katinkapaulsen": "Traumavores and People of colonial expression \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 laughed so hard at this.
