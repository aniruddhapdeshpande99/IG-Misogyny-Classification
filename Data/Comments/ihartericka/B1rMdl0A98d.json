The meat industry (in the US in particular) has extremely negative impacts on POC in the americas especially. Undocumented immigrants are the primary workers in slaughter houses (and all industrialized agriculture).

While working in the US, these people are paid extremely low wages, face high rates of sexual harassment, PTSD and suicide. And where are these CFO\u2019s and slaughter houses built?
