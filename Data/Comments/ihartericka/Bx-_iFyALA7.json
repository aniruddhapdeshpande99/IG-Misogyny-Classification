Teach her to stay out of the area while you\u2019re eating if you want to avoid future begging. Socialize, socialize, socialize!! I would suggest watching some basic training videos on YouTube before issues even arise because they\u2019re overall a great glimpse into dog psychology.

Cutting off little slivers instead of a big chunk is best and be careful with the quick. Trust me you want your dog to learn to trust the clippers now as you may already know.

Usually it\u2019s twice a day depending on the breed, it could be more/less, but generally puppies from breeders are given food all day to eat at their leisure. This can lead to food-aggression/resource guarding which is honestly such a pain for you and your dog. Also treat every toy and food as if it is yours first and you are simply sharing it with your pup. Take toys, beds, treats/bones away randomly and then give them back so your dog knows not to feel anxious about guarding it. This is one thing that can develop early on and it\u2019s really tough to reverse it, so it\u2019s good to nip it while they are young! This is advice I wish I had when we got our puppy!
