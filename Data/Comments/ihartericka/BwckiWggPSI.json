{"wakeupandapologize2019": "@ihartericka Very similar - however, I want to address what you were saying about Black women being considered strong -ALWAYS - there used to be a show on BET (I think) called 'The RunDown with Robin Thede (which coincidentally is no longer on air and this show was the BOMB! it spoke of all types of racial things in a humorous but informative way) - Robin conducted a survey with all people of color, like the white doll/black doll study done with children in the '50's -- the topic was which group of ppl could endure the most pain and two pictures were held up - one picture with black person/ppl and one picture with white person/ppl. Most, if not all people chose the Black people to be able to endure pain most, in fact, many doctors do not prescribe the correct pain management to people of color because they 'feel' or 'believe' that Black people have a higher tolerance of pain than their white counterparts. You can find 'The RunDown with Robin Thede' on YouTube if you have not already been introduced to the show.

I am white and when I was younger I had my hair every color in the rainbow.

People did act like I was from a different planet most of the time, grabbing my hair and making a scene and asking for pictures. It was annoying and I thought they were stupid. Pink hair feels the same as brown hair (and even if it doesn\u2019t WHY are you touching me?!) and I know they have heard of hairspray, so I didn\u2019t get what was happening. None of them were asking questions because they were really about to go do their hair the same way, they were just amused, the way they would be if they saw a circus clown at the grocery store, and they engaged with me to further amuse themselves. Imagine being an average person who does their hair in a usual way and isn\u2019t out here trying to create a masterpiece to be judged everyday but just exist and navigate your day like anyone else, and you get treated that way. That is what happens to black people. A lot. I could stop doing my hair that way and the idiots disappeared.

The last few years, following you and others, ive for sure become more mindful of the intent behind saying something out loud to a Black woman. it's a Presumed Intimacy with another, to think I can bring attention to their appearance in public. I'm not okay when a man I don't know does it to me, so why would I not bring that awareness to my interactions with others in public settings. so I check myself before blurting out, 'that yellow looks amazing on you' which @ihartericka it does \ud83d\ude18.

At school, when visiting friend\u2019s houses, just out and about...Black girls expected to behave in such a such way in order to make sure white girls feel special. I remember dressing to impress the popular white girls. But looking back I know they did that Regina George \u201cthat is the ugliest effing skirt\u201d shit behind my back. The reason they have this sense of entitlement as adults is because it\u2019s what they\u2019ve been used to for decades...at the expense of Black and Brown girls. Ya know?
