There should be no downplaying of how horrific it was. However that is a separate matter to what happened last night. Its just a completely different matter, there was no racism or anything like that involved, and it was not a terror attack. Its just the fact that the Notre Dame was a symbol of France and its survived through German bombing, and two World Wars. Ofcourse people are going to be upset by it.

This post is not telling you not to be sad about Notre Dame but is calling out how the world stage turns its back to burnings of black churches. I admit i don\u2019t know how old these churches were, but we must also take into account that Notre Dame is ancient and the reason why people are paying attention to its burning isn\u2019t exclusively because it\u2019s in a european country.
