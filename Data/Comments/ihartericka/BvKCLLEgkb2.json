I\u2019ve been a full time survivor since birth, if we\u2019re being honest- more recently I lost a huge source of financial stability and have been struggling financially which has hurt me a lot emotionally. I need reparations to help kill my debt, help with bills, RENT, food, and in order to make room for real savings which will allow me to create a place of healing for all POC specifically Black and Brown people.
