I'm a hairy woman (arms, legs, face, etc.)and cannot help what grows out of my body. Typically I don't shave my legs, pits, unless I'm going to wear a swimsuit. My pubes I trim when I get too hot down there. I think it has been helpful that my guy doesn't judge me for my hairy body, but he loves it. It helped me to feel better about not wanting to shave. I also feel like shaving is a chore, maybe it wouldn't feel like that if I didn't feel like I was doing it for society. I still think about people judging me if I have hair, but I know I shouldn't. Still working on that. I was listening to the radio a few weeks ago and they had a discussion about hairy women. The guy said 99% of men don't like hairy women, and the 1% of men are weirdos for liking it(made up data). I was offended by that because why is a man weird for liking a woman with hair? Why is a woman grss for having hair? The 2 women on the show said ewww...hair is gross. I shave daily, the other one said I shave every other day. That conversation is furthering the beauty standard of no hair is sexy. Why couldn't the conversation have been I prefer women with no hair, or I prefer women who shave, but women who don't are still beautiful. It's about self-love and doing what an individual feels best.

I can remember begging my mom to let me shave my legs and armpits. Even as an adult, I used to hide my legs if I hadn't had a chance to shave them and I kept my armpits bald. I was made to feel like it was a matter of hygiene and propriety. However, over these past couple of years, I've come to love my body hair. I don't remove any of it unless I just want to, for me. (I do enjoy that silky smooth feeling sometimes.) I love my hirsute body more though. And it is PLENTY hirsute.", "fkajoseph": "I always say if we weren't meant to have it, it wouldn't grow. I listened to a podcast recently and a girl put it better than I could and I always say this anytime someone brings up my body hair now \"THE ABSENCE OF BODY HAIR IS INDICATIVE OF A PRE PUBESCENT BODY AND THE FACT THAT THAT IS WHAT SOME PEOPLE FIND ATTRACTIVE OR LUST AFTER SAYS MORE ABOUT THEM THAN IT DOES ABOUT THE PERSON WITH THE BODY HAIR\"", "maryjump": "I used to care a lot more about hair but my friend once said, \u201cthey\u2019ll fuck you with a bush as much as they\u2019ll fuck you without one.\u201d She was right.", "elyssium7779": "Really struggle with my body, feels about it, toward it, pcocs diagnosis gives me a good idea that my amount isn't \"typical\".

I don\u2019t don\u2019t do that shit, never have, my body is what it is, and I\u2019ve found that not removing the hair on my body keeps a lot of shitty people away from me, sexually. Like, I just wouldn\u2019t ever be intimate with someone who thinks body hair removal is mandatory. I\u2019ve never had any complaints, and I\u2019ve mostly been intimate with cis men. Not once has any person I\u2019ve ever been with either complained or commented on my body hair, unless to say it\u2019s sexy, and if someone asked me to remove hair from my body, that would tell me we just aren\u2019t compatible. Back in the 90s it felt revolutionary to not shave because we were few and far between, but when I was a kid working in farmers markets with my folks in the 80s, I remember seeing this lesbian couple at a market one day, I was around 10, they were holding hands and were boldly queer for 1986, but the part that stood out to me most was their super hairy legs, I thought that was so cool as I\u2019d never seen any women with hair on their legs in public like that. I wanted to shave like a lot of girls at 11 or 12 but by age 15 or so I was so nature hippie oriented I fully rejected hair removal. I worked in Salons and spas about a decade ago, so I experimented with it when I was there and it was painful and pricey so I didn\u2019t continue that practice and do ever plan to.
