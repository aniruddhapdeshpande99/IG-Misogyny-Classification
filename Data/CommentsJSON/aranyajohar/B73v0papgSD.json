Poetry isn't just a hobby, it's my passion, it's a way of living a better life, it's the one thing I live by. I am an amateur poet who writes in order to create a world of her own where she can live away from the vile realities of this world. But other than poetry there is something that makes my heart race too. That is being able to help poor people specially underprivileged children. I believe the smile on their face can instantly lift up one's mood. That smile I get when I give them small gifts like chocolates, books, new clothes during festival makes my day a hundred times better and I'll keep on doing so. I believe we are what we do and not what people think us to be and hence I try to be my best self to myself and those people who are looked down up.
