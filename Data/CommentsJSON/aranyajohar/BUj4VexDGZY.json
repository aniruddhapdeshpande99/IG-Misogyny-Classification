I love the concept of empowerment and I do think that there is so much that needs to be changed around the Stigma of menstruation. The only thing that I would like to offer is that what some people might view as a negative thing ( to stop, for example) some see as a very positive thing. The Earth has to 'stop' every winter so that the flowers can gently bloom in spring. I feel that our modern day culture doesn't appreciate 'stopping' and therefore doesn't appreciate the calling inward that the period brings ( if we are open to it). With that in mind I would have said 'periods are a reminder to stop' which is so needed in our fast-paced culture. \ud83d\ude09 this is just a reflection.
