I know I\u2019ve been weary of giving for these reasons, like I want to buy you something but am I doing it for you or for me. When I realised it was for me, I stopped myself but when it comes to things someone bought me because I have such an attachment I have to let myself see it all the time so I get over the feelings I get when I see it until it\u2019s just a tee again.

The act of giving is more for the giver than it is for the recipient (I think). We should always give (with a humble heart, at that) because we want to express an internal love/care/feeling for another. I think the gift is kind of the byproduct of the FEELING. I believe most (not all, bc sometimes ppl just want shinny shit) gifts should be things that are needed; whether we gather that from observation or interrogation. And \u201cneeded\u201d doesn\u2019t need to be totally utilitarian; someone may need a beautifully written note or a date/trip/time. I love to give gifts, but I\u2019ve had to learn to do so at a rate that would not deplete me financially or subject me, emotionally (as some ppl think that when you give once, it means that they expect you to give again and again). As for the necklace you are still holding onto, I think you should let it go if it illicits hurt and negative feelings. Although you have it hidden away in a box that you do not touch, in your mind, you know it\u2019s there. Your thoughts about it may even grow and take up more space that the box that holds the necklace itself (slash I\u2019m sure you could buy yourself one if you wanted, bc you a #bossbabe). If it doesn\u2019t hurt you, I hope the necklace at least reminds you that once upon a time, that person felt something special for you BECAUSE you ARE special. Even if they don\u2019t feel that way now, guess what? You\u2019re STILL extraordinary. Thanks for sharing another piece of you. \ud83d\udc9c", "academicladym": "What a great post!

So many of us are not honest with ourselves about our motives behind the gifts we give. Thank you for sharing this. What we do in essence when we use gifts as a plea to stay is manipulation. And that is never pretty to see in ourselves. This is also such a reflection of attitude towards the non material things we give: love, respect etc and that last point really resonated.

Why would we have expectations of someone loving, respecting, honoring, being honest, standing up for us when it\u2019s not someone we would do for ourselves.
