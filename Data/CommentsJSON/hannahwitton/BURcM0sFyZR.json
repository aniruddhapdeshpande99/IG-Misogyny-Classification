I've been feeling the same about my body but as long as you're happy and healthy. You look absolutely bomb \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb", "ailis_steele": "I had this because all of my proportions stayed the same but I put on a tiny bit more around my waist and then all of the sudden... jeans don't fit, skirts don't fit, having to go up a size in bottoms when I've been steadily the same size since I was 16, and even though I've been more active than I've been in years. I had a melt down before a music festival because I had the choice of wearing something I'd freeze my arse off in or wearing jeans that were uncomfortable because they didn't fit. Went with the jeans, but I'm just going to buy new jeans (old ones have a hole anyway) and if I lose the weight, get them altered at the waist. No point ripping myself to shreds trying to fit into jeans that simply don't fit, and bigger clothes can always be made smaller.", "delinapham": "i love this so much and hannah i love you so much no matter what you are such a wonderful inspiration ahhh just thank you \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "rae__elizabeth": "10/10 body and 10/10 bikini, where is it from please?
