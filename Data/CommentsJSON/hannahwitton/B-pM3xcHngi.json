We cope by going on a walk most days so we can have an activity to do and by me spending a lot of evenings video chatting with friends. He sometimes joins for an hour or so and then goes off to do his own thing.

I love wfh and feel more relaxed with no commute and less oversight. For my partner wfh is tough because he needs daily coworker interaction. It helps that we've got a 1 bedroom apartment.

We live together, myself being a student of a closed university, him being a worker of a closed factory. So we are in full isolation together. Most of the time things are great, but as you can imagine he often struggles with never getting some form of break from eachother. As I'm an extrovert, it doesn't bother me as much as constantly being in people's company is something I love. We've set a plan that he gets a few hours a day to himself, in a separate room. I can, of course pop in if I like, but I want to give him that space so he can rejuvenate his energy with some me time. It seems to be helping him alot.

I\u2019ve been off of work for two weeks (I am a teacher on a modified summer schedule in Canada which means I get two weeks of spring break) abs we are now just starting to tackle how to balance needs. The biggest thing we\u2019ve landed on is not hanging out as much during our respective \u201cwork days\u201d and scheduling in time at night for each other, while being mindful of our needs to separately connect with friends and family. So far it\u2019s been okay, with the exception of a few instances of me being extra social and him being extra in need to quiet. It\u2019s a bit tough trying to navigate this in a small apartment, but we\u2019ve also managed to carve our separate spaces in the home for each of us, whereas before only he had a separate office (I have a desk in our dining room now).", "mazcirca1984": "Interesting I'm an introverted extrovert (husband is the same) so we can spend time apart doing other things quite happily.
