About two years ago i tried going off hormonal contraception and i had heard a lot about the coil, mostly good things so after thinking about it i decided to take a chance and got it done. The procedure was alright, but I didnt expect it to be a walk in the park anyway. For my first check-up the doctor told me the coil had moved and I would have to try again with another one, that was bigger. Luckily it was free of charge. When I got the second coil inserted it didnt hurt at all, which i was super glad about. After that tho, my period got really strong even tho I was used to a medium flow. At the next check-up my doc then told me the coil had moved again and once again i had to get it taken out. They suggested I could try another type of coil but it might be possible that my uterus just rejects the object inside me and thats why it moved both times, so i decided against it. I really wanted the coil to work because hormonal contraception is the only option now since i dont like using condoms in the long run. I was also horrified at the possibility, that since the coil must have moved at some point in the six months between check ups, that i could have gotten pregnant, could have had a miscarriage and the likes..", "lucy.stuartt": "Dear Levelen ED, you are damn reliable.

And that is how you arrived in my life. Although I welcomed you with open arms, you treated me horribly. It was not your fault; I did not go through a proper consultation before taking you.

With you, my skin was clear and glowing, my periods became a safe pattern and you made me so happy. But still, something was nagging at me and I didn\u2019t know what it was. While I was happy you were in my life, it felt like an arranged marriage. You were forced on me by the doctors and I was too young to ask anything about you and what you would do to me. As the years passed the symptoms of our relationship started springing up and it became hard to deny you were taking more from me than you were prepred to give. As new hormonal issues appeared and my anxiety grew I didn\u2019t know how much longer we could stay together. And as the years passed, I grew resentful of you, yet everyone told me not to leave you. Today I saw a new doctor. She told me I can leave if I want to. She says there is a different way than the only one I\u2019ve known. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s right, or how I will live without you, but I know I need to try.

That fear followed me around for four years and, though it slowly fades, it can never fully be gone. My fear of sex stems from you - it's not entirely your fault, no, that lies with my ex-boyfriend leaving me two days after I started taking the pill for him - but, to this day, I can't have sex with a condom on. I'll never be able to have a one night stand. I'll have to be extra cautious with my sexual health. It look me a long to work out where my anxiety, I'd go so far as to say phobia, originated from. But now I know. And I just wanted to say that I don't know if I'll ever trust you again and, even though I know it's irrational, that one mishap has affected my sexuality and my confidence forever.

I\u2019ve also had a little weight gain but I\u2019m not entirely sure it\u2019s because of the patch, or because Ive recently gotten into a relationship and have been happily munching on shitty food with my boyfriend. Patch placement is a little tricky, because if you don\u2019t want it to be seen, (because it can look gross with black fluffy around the edgy, no matter what you wear) most likely it\u2019ll get caught on clothing. I once put it in my back thinking it would be fine, then put on my bra and realised it could be a problem. I was cautious for a few days, then one night with my boyfriend, clothes are coming off and so does the patch. Totally killed the mood by rushing to put another one on ASAP.

My life became a constant need to find a loo to change my pad or tampon, or when the time had finally passed to take more pain relief, but now you want to try take away my fertility.. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll fight for it but you won\u2019t fight as hard as me. Until the next post, my endometriosis, from and always will be Heidi.", "jerome_meunier_": "Great shot still beautiful", "meg_george": "Dear pill, You have helped me in many ways from stopping me from being pregnant to easing the pain my cramps used to give me. You have never given me trouble! Keep it up! Meg", "cataagallo": "Dear Gianda, I started using you 10 years ago when I found out I had PCOS and was told I\u2019d have a hard time getting pregnant... I was too young to fully understand and wasn\u2019t even thinking about having kids. Now this new doctor tells me it makes no sense to want kids and give my body something everyday that tells it I don\u2019t... it might be time to let you go. Thank you", "lu.m.j.p": "Dear Cilest, you gave me nausea and then made me vomit twice in the first 3 days, then gave me 3 horrendous migraines accompanied with a lot of vomiting and nit being able to see for long periods of time. Cerazette , on the other hand, you are wonderful- thank you", "sioned_morfydd_": "Dear Millenette, I take you everyday but you\u2019ve made me gain weight and you make my acne worse not better like my doctor had said. But you\u2019re doing great as a contraceptive so thanks for that part, pms and migraines aside. You\u2019ll do for now xx", "thatlauralouise": "Dear my implant, I haven't had you for a year yet, but thank you for being the one for me. In February I walked into my local sexual health clinic to have a conversation about contraception options, and I walked out with you in my arm. You haven't affected my emotions negatively, you've slowed down my periods and fixed my cramps. I barely notice you're there and I'm so grateful to you for protecting me. Keep doing what you're doing. All the best, Laura \u2764\ufe0f", "georgixox0": "Dear microgynon we met when I was 13, i always felt ashamed of you, you always felt like my dirty little secret and in hind sight maybe us meeting could have waited a few more years. But here we are now, I have made my peace with you and my body, thanks for everything, love Georgia", "rekhagarton": "Dear Cerelle, you've been ditched by the doctor and I've been given back cerezette today out of all days ironically. Thanks for the changes in periods, black hairs and unusual headaches but I'm welcoming cerezette back with open arms.", "annaherridge98": "Dear coil, I still don\u2019t know if you were the right move for me, we\u2019re six months into our relationship together and to say we got off to a rocky start is an understatement. After our first attempt together with you giving me pelvic inflammatory disease leading to sepsis and hospitalisation, its a miracle I didn\u2019t break up with you then and there. And even now while I\u2019m receiving therapy for the PTSD you caused me and the anxiety you\u2019ve given me, I\u2019m sticking with you in a hopes we can work it out. Please just control my cycle and pain while I\u2019m travelling the globe next year, take care of me like you should do and cause me no more pain. I\u2019m sure we can work this out x", "beth_tto": "Dear cerazette, please stop making me feel like utter crap on the first dah of each pack! I don't enjoy crying for no reason!

From Beth", "cierajaneb": "Dear Cerazette, you were the first contraceptive pill I ever took and 6 years later we are still here, I\u2019m so glad you were the first I tried and you caused no trouble. I haven\u2019t had a period in 6 years (which I\u2019m thinking I may need to change soon, don\u2019t feel like this is good for me) thank you for the lack of babies I do appreciate that for now (despite the many scares) love, Ciera x", "beth_metal": "Dear birth control, please stop giving me migraines and making me ill.
