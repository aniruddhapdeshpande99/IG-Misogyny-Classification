I was sick one day in grade 8 and a girl who did not like me even though she did not know me from Eve asked if I was pregnant and as a joke I said yes because the idea of a 13 year old being pregnant was so absurd to me at the time that I thought it was obviously a joke. That joke got away from me was taken at face value and by the end of the month I had been met with an Easy A style ruined reputation (a film which funnily enough came out at the exact same time.) The girl who thought that holding hands after a month of dating was too soon for her own Comfort level was now being referred to as the school bike. A bet was started and some guy started asking me out to which I said yes and the relationships quickly dissolved after they realized how untrue those rumors were. I still thought it was hilarious at this point and kept on finding it funny until some of the guys started getting quite aggressive about what they had felt my reputation had promised them. Nothing ever happened but there were a few close calls that scared me and it stopped being funny. In my late teens a family member lost it on me when they found out I had lost my virginity to the boy who later this year will become my husband. I have no ill-will against this family member because their fear stemmed from the fact that they thought me being sexually active would derail my future and they had worked so hard to make sure I had a good life but at the time being threatened with a doctor's appointment to check if my hymen was intact was terrifying. Because of all of this the idea of anyone knowing that I was sexually active terrified me. And I fully supported everyone else's right to be a sexually active as they wanted to I would never call anyone the names that I was called because I believe that every person has a right to do with their body what they choose to.
