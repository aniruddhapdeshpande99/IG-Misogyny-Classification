Because I look perfectly normal on the outside. And many women don't even now that this can happen. I was one of them too. I believed that if I just do my pelvic floor excercises aka Kegels I will be fine. Now I know, it's just not true. Your pelvic muscles can even ripp off from the pelvic bone and no amount of Kegels or physical therapy can attach them back. And there is also no surgery which can really fix it. Surgery is all about reducing symptoms. Not making a woman whole again. So my life is now all about trying to accept my limits and trying to be happy with what is left.

The doctor I saw then explained to me what was really happening in my body. And I am now taking m\u00e9decine that basically suppresses any male hormone in my body. (But only after I spent 2 months on the pill and gained 15 kgs yikes) So PCOS. There\u2019s a few reasons as to why I want to tell you to fuck right the hell out of my body : Making it extremely difficult to loose weight, even a couple of kgs. Making my period sometimes very painful. Making it harder for me to have children but easier to get diabetes. Making my cycle extremely unpredictable : will it last 15 days ? Will it last 28 days ? Will it last 41 days ? Nobody will ever know beforehand. And a pattern must never be revealed. I hope that in the future someone will find a cure and eradicate you. Sincerely, Camille.", "feetthattravel": "Dear Fibroids and Endometriosis. It only took about 6 years of doctors visits for someone to actually listen to me.

Not going to miss you. Love, Lily-Rose xx", "xrandomprincessx": "\"Dear UTIs we have only met twice back to back and it was horrible. The pain was unbearable but no one beliving my pain was suffocating. Relatives making it about themselves oh \"I had that pain as well jusy take painkillers\". Like no cousin brother unless you have a vagina I know for a fact you have never had this pain nor will ever understand it. Painkillers did not help me but bless who ever made hot water bottles. Female relatives dismissing it and saying \"oh you need to lose weight it's because you are fat\". Like this intense pain is not from \"gas\" or \"from sitting all day\" or \"because of all the fat surrounding my stomach\". It took going to a walkin in clinic in tears caz I couldnt handle the pain or be told again to call back tomorrow at 8am. The female doctor took one sad look at my hand clutching my lower stomach and said \"I think you have a urinary tract infection\". I thought only sexually active people got it but nope virgins can get it too. UTIs you might have gone for a week and then come back with a vengence but you taught me my body works so hard, is so strong and badass. What hurt the most wasnt your torture but the misunderstanding and belittlment of female pain. Most shocking the minimasation from not men but from other females. Lets love each other, learn about one another and support each other. UTIS you can still go f*** off though no one wants to deal with you.
