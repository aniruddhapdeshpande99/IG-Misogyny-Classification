Your logic supports the fact that all Muslims are terrorists which is bizarre just the way this post is. No, if you will yell or abuse or go haywire over me I won\u2019t give you threats or abuse or whatever you can think with that brain because Not everyone is been the way you have been assuming. Yes, what happened is terrifying and it\u2019s more saddening than raising any rage you know why? Because the those who did it were children, minors and not men. Their actions are not justified but they ain\u2019t the real cause. The cause is parents who gave them resources but didn\u2019t tell them how to use them properly. Parents who didn\u2019t tell their child how not to objectify anyone. And yes, my definition of parents include a mother as well. You know who else to blame on?

Even if I do take the stance that all men perpetuate misogyny and patriarchy I can\u2019t help but ask why women are ignored in this assumption. The thing about systemic misogyny is that everyone is a part of the system. If you are to take the stance that such a system exists you can\u2019t ignore that both men and women are affected and henceforth perpetuate it. How many times in your own life have you seen women perpetuate misogyny? Personally I think many women, perhaps even the majority, also act in a way that perpetuates misogyny to some degree (have you?). At least this is true in my own life. If I were to assume that such a patriarchal system exists it would be dishonest to ignore the effect that women\u2019s actions have towards perpetuating it, even if they themselves are harmed. While yes men benefit from a patriarchal system we cannot then assume that women are therefore solely victims to the system. Women who behave in a way that perpetuates patriarchy may still be victims to it, but they are also perpetrators. The actions of misogynistic women hurt women just as much as misogynistic men. We shouldn\u2019t think of the issue in terms of \u201cmen perpetuate misogyny, men need to change\u201d. Anyone who perpetuates misogyny should change, including women. that\u2019s why I disagree with the mindset of \u201cyes all men\u201d. Not because I disagree that all men perpetuate misogyny ( I do but that\u2019s not why I have problems with the mindset) but because it completely ignores the impact that women and all other non-males have in perpetuating misogyny.
