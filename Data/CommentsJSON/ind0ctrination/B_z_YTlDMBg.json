Just like all straight people are homophobic by default as they just don\u2019t have previous experiences to base their judgement on, all men are sexist given that they have no previous experience of being a women to base it on. Privilege here is more than just being a men, it\u2019s about the ability of refusal to listen as it shatters and changes your world view. I mean as someone who finds masculinity as a part of my identity and redefining it as a part of the process of being comfortable with myself, the notion of calling men trash does hit home. It can feel very dehumanising to have to challenge that identity but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough of a reason to give the larger idea of this away.

Every man, who grew up to be a sexist, had probably been influenced by both men and women in their lives in every aspect, including gender sensitivity. So, I think not just all men, but every human. In this sense, all men seems a bit narrow. 2. At some point in life, we make choices - political inclination, religious beliefs, societal rights and wrongs etc. So, many a times, when people say that patriarchy originated from men, hence men are the accountable even for those women who regress women. Then it seems like at some point it is a choice everyone, irrespective of sex, has to make - whether to continue what I was told and taught or to break the mould, just like, say, the child of a smoker may or may not become a smoker. 3. Does all men take into consideration that the men who actually want gender equality may feel disappointed that they, despite not causing harm, are being made to feel unjustified and could it not hamper their mental health?
