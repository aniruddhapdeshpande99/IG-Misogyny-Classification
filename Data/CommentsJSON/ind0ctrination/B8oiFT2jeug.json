And I have exactly faced the same shit, I m telling u the exact shit from men and I made it a point that I confront each and every men who makes me feel I m trash. Most of the times, according to a few men, we woman has to have worth, so that our modesty can be outraged, our rights be violated in public, your experience reminded me of an incident which happened to me two years back. Where I was starred with nasty gestures for over 20 mins and when I confronted them they told me \"tere me hain kya, jo hum tujhe dekhe\" And when I choose to call the police because he did and spoke every word to malign my character. His mother and other locals supported him by saying that \"tere jaise randy ko nahi bolenge toh kisko bolnge\" And they threatened me by saying \"humare beta police me hain, woh tujhe dekh lega\" Considering the very fact that I m a woman and I m from North East they assumed everything. Thinking of the situation, nobody deserve to be treated this way. Not any woman, a student or a prostitute, or wherever she is from. So you are true, we should never be quite not until it is made known, clear and loud. Not until every ounch of trash is cleaned. I m proud that I have dragged those trash into court. Last but not the least, more power to each and every woman. We shall fight we shall win.", "pokeronn": "I had a similar experience when I was out with my friends. We noticed continuous flash in our direction as if they were clicking our pictures, I asked one of the boys who was clicking Pictures with a camera to show us what all he clicked. He showed us the pictures he clicked and then we asked other boys to show us their phones because we were still doubting on them, what if they deleted Pictures on their camera when they saw us walking or what if they still have pictures on their phone. One of the guys refused and started \"yelling ki are you prostitutes that we'll click your pictures?\" I was like even if we were you have no right to. This boy who was yelling was trying to start a fight and pouncing on me, his friends stopped him and mine took me back.", "komal____bhardwaj": "This is what a lot of us have experienced too and we just ignore this as these shits are pretty normal.

This really sucks. I hope people could realize this that we live in modern society and the world couldn't be a better place unless we do something.
