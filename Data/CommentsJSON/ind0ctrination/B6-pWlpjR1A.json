I find it a painful reminder of everyone that continues to see my existence as skin showing, attention whoring, unnecessary - be it peer or professor. I wonder if I'll get to protest on the streets. However, from my very first day in medical school to this day/ABCD, when I showed up feeling more comfortable in my skin than ever before, I figured that there exists one thing no amount of disrespect or disregard will ever take away from me - my ability to make my presence felt, online or off, to make my voice heard. That will continue in whatever capacity, limited by whatever circumstance. That much I will continue to do. The sash certifies it. @allan_castelino and others at @manipalthetalk - THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THESE GORGEOUS PHOTOS!", "theblindpixel": "\u2764\ufe0f"}
