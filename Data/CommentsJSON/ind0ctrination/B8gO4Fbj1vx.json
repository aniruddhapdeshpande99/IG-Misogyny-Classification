I'm so, extremely sorry you had to go through this. I tried messaging you earlier to talk about something similar, though I'm guessing you currently don't have the spoons to deal with what may come your way as you read my message. So I'd honestly and sincerely recommend staying clear of me. I just want you to know that if ever you wish to talk, so long as I'm alive (not sure how long that's gonna last given my current state of mind) and have access to the net, I will be there to listen. I'm a 22 year old pre-op trans girl, so I can imagine what you must have felt. I don't know if you're in a vulnerable state right now or not, and what I'm about to say stands regardless of how vulnerable you are when you read it (if you read it)... you're beautiful, wonderful, amazing, lovable and worth being happy and respected. I'm not sure how many times you've heard this before, though I'm gonna say it anyway, I really look up to you and respect you.
