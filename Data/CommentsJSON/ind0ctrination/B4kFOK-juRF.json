One has to remember - much as I, a trans woman, like any other human being have no absolute right to be wanted and desired, I do have the right to question what we as a society deem desirable - to question our notions of womanhood and who/what constitutes a woman - because respect, attraction - these things are never fully inherent to us. So much is conditioned/acquired, tied intricately to structural notions of what we as a society deem worthy. My response to this marginalisation is almost always the same - it lies in asking to be seen, understood, desired for the person that I am, and for most, it is asking for too much. We have no choice but to persevere, and hope that in this impossible struggle to find worth within, those around us do too. Sometimes, lovers take photos like this one, we'll pose like we belong on the cover of Vogue, statuesque. Much like anyone that has been marginalized one way or another, I too hope that in the learned confidence the world sees, those around us also see how active an effort it is not to feel dirty. I too hope, that one day, someone like me can think about curing disease without feeling like one everyday. #TransIsBeautiful", "nupurr._": "\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f \u2764\ufe0f all my respect and power to you\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "funkybindiqueen": "You just must hear it one more time love - you are brave, you are strong, you are beautiful.
