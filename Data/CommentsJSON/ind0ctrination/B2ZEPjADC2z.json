{"aravindx25": "@ind0ctrination Well in life we have to go through multiple levels of trial and errors and this is one of the tricikest of them all-who to let it and who to ignore.I think that only thing thats positive about each trial is getting a result and understanding it so that we can try again a little better. I gave up the idea long time ago,the idea that someone exist just for you.Im slowly convincinv my heart that such person is like a unicorn-does not exist. In the end,PEOPLE WHO WANT TO STAY WILL STAY and PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LEAVE WILL LEAVE no matter what we do.So thank all ppl who stayed, and welcome more and repeat.More power for you for future trial amd error.And as always, Beautiful snap \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc95", "devibha64": "Beautiful ma'am \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc9e\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "anugummaraju": "Hugs.

This piece speaks to my heart right now, right where it hurts. My body has been insulted, asexualized and scrutinised. A woman is taught to be whomever men want. If your body isn't enticing enough to them, you can mother them, you can do emotional labor while they continue to try to fit you in a box where you feel isolated and unable to love what you see in the mirror. I'm sorry I ever let those people say what they've said to me, do what they have done to me. I cannot pretend to imagine that I understand your journey to your first home. But I do understand that the world makes it indescribably hard for us to not start hammering down the home we built with so much courage.
