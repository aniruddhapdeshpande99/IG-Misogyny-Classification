You really are a role model. @ind0ctrination thank you for validating what I feel about transitioning. I used to be so open to the world. I used to almost walk with a tag in my forehead that says \"trans\" to make sure everyone know. But i noticed, it made my dysphoria even worse. Because then a lot of people would ask me questions I am not okay to discuss.. . Like genitals and stuff, and people then starts claiming I am distinguishable. See I grew up hating myself, my body, my life. I was suicidal. I didn't care about my own life because I thought I didn't deserve to live. But transition gave me new hopes and dreams. It made me felt right to be alive. Although I am still living with anxiety and depression, now I have the drive to fight to live. You're right, we all have the right to be visible and invisible in the unsafe world and we can always switch between those.
