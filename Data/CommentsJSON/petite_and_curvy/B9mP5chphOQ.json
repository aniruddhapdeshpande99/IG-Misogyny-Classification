Just to say from North Italy near Milan do not underestimate this virus which has become a pandemic. The health system here is making huge efforts to save everyone.

No one wants to scare their loved ones unnecessarily, the whole world is scared right now and shutting themselves from each other. If travel cannot be avoided, precautions is all one can take. The cases that soared here in UK happened exactly after term break when most families returned from Europe and other destinations and unknowingly brought infections here via travel. We all by now know where this virus originated and how it has travelled world over.
