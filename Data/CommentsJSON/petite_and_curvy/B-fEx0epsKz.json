I read that disinfecting is not necessary.. it all comes down to good hand washing. Washing your hands before/after preparing food. As well as before and after eating your food. But i also read, if it makes you feel better, you can disinfect your cans, or boxes. Running water, lemon water, or vinegar water should be enough to clean fruit and veggies. If I\u2019m going to get covid it\u2019s going to be from my husband who works in the medical field.. so I am doing what I can, but I\u2019m not over doing it as a lot of these cleaning products are just as harmful to our health as this virus could be.", "shechonky": "I know you\u2019re not the only one doing that for sure!
