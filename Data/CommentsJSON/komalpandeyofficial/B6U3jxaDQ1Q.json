CAA+NRC isn't going to benefit any one group of voters. The need to give citizenship to persecuted minorities has been bipartisan. I can't see why anyone would stand against that. CAA is only for people who has migrated before 2014 , they are already in our country ,country is already spending money on them ,citizenship would give these people opportunities to work 2) about NRC in Assam I would just say that search for number that how many illegals immigrants has migrated in last few years , it\u2019s not threat to any religion but it\u2019s threat to the citizens of the state - not having a single document is not justified excuse - you can still bring two witnesses in your favour for verdicts .  so called Educated People who have had read the act carefully wouldn\u2019t have mislead people on the streets on name of religion . this is creating hate and chaos , don\u2019t they understand how they are impacting country\u2019s economy now ?
