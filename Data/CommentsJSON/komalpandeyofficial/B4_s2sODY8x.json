Coming to the #giveaway , wouldn't say much on this just 1) why I want to be styled by you? Well, ma'am being said you are a gem and your existence a blessing to us. I relate with you on so many levels. Komal, you helped me with self respect and self empowerment. I broke up with the guy I was in a super toxic relationship with after watching your video and realizing what I am doing to myself , and you and your videos , your thoughts made me survive that post breakup phase. I thank you for that, so why I wanna be a part of this? Simply because first I want to meet and talk to you and hug you\ud83d\ude2d 2nd I also relate with your style so much but even after multiple tries ( for obvious reasons ) I am not able to style my daily outfits in a sustainable way as I come from a middle class family and for that I definitely need your help and styling. 2) what makes people fall in love with me?
