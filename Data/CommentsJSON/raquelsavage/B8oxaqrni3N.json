But \u201ctitles\u201d as restrictive as they can be at least do define in a sense where you are at, and the privileges that come with said title. However when you are human things happen and at times not at the same pace or even that you ask them to happen. Im finding that im strengthening my inner monologue to be able to work through things that may come up emotionally for me that may contradict my personal ideals and philosophies about love and relationships. Allowing myself to be human and continue to grow an expand my mind by questioning myself regarding my emotional states without having to impose those uncertainties and confusion on my partner or love interest. It\u2019s amazing being able to process and work through your feelings with out denying or feeling intense guilt and shame.", "lovelustlissa": "I need to work harder on expressing my feelings logically like this.
