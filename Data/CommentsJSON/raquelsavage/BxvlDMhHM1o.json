Playing with other people both Men and Women was okay but I didn't really swing either way but I like images of Naked Women, just don't feel compelled to be with one. It was during My teens that I was a bater but closeted. I lived with a Psychotic Holy Roller Mother who couldn't manage life. I couldn't wait for Her to leave the house from time to time so I could play with Myself. During My early adulthood, I used to pet with guys and a couple of females but no orifice till I was 27. I used to come out as a bater before then. it was 32 I stopped using orifice because I didn't roll that way really. I'm not an angry MGTOW type because I believe Women have the right to live the way They want.
