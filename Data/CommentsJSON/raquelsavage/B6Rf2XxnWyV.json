I am on a continuous journey to gentle parenting . It is hard! The hardest part for me has been unpacking WHY the things they do make me upset. Especially in pursuing my degree I know better and a lot of things we find \u201cdisrespectful \u201c are age appropriate behavior. Even the teenagers! I realized a lot of my triggers were based off the fact that I was jealous of my kids. I had a horrible child hood and my kids had things and circumstances I only dreamt about.

She told a boy she liked him or something other and egged on by my family, I spanked her. After I spanked her, I remember her looking at me with such fear in her eyes (she had the biggest prettiest brown eyes; I used to call them cow eyes) and it just broke my heart. Right in that moment, I vowed to never spank her again. And I never did. I didn\u2019t want the one I loved the most and who loved me the most to ever fear me. Respect me, yes, but fear me - no. It wasn\u2019t always easy going against the norm, especially with those on the outside telling me I was spoiling her by: letting her speak her mind, giving her the benefit of the doubt and allowing her to be her own person without beating her brains out. I figured out other ways to discipline her- like making her write essays when she messed up about what she did, why I was upset and how she would, moving forward, do better - oh, how she hated those essays. I remember her telling me to just spank her one time.\ud83d\ude02 I stood my ground no matter what anybody said cuz I knew in my heart that there was another way and just because my father beat the dog shit out me didn\u2019t mean I had to do my own the same way and it paid off.
