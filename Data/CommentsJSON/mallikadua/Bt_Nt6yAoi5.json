Right now the sentiments are high, I won't call it Josh. Because we as a country are high on emotions as always, that's how we are tuned for some weird reason. We get emotional too soon and then we act out of our emotions. The prime minister knows that, and to cash on this \"opportunity\" he said that \"unhone bahot badi galti kardi hai\". My dear fellow countrymen, do not get so hyper by these words of our PM. doesn't mean we are going to war. He said it because he knows what the janta wants. War is not the solution. And do you think we don't retaliate to such incidents? We do! Every single day men die who you are not even aware about. their deaths are not known to you, but every single day a soldier dies at the line of duty. So don't think even for a second that the country is coward and that we need to take action. As far as actions are concerned, that would be at the right time at the right place. But that's not for us to decide, for the sentimental public. So keep ur emotions in check. Kashmir issue has only a political solution. There is no military solution for that.

We as a country have always preferred due diligence and this has been the reason that Pakistan govt.

Due to such thinking china has been able to surround india by its string of pearls but obviously why do you care because you are just a person who thinks usa will come and steal the show. NO THEY WONT I REPEAT THEY WONT.USA will never entangle itself in this mess and neither any else country will. We as a nation needs to protect ourselves and that includes the nation destroying the militant thresholds in POK and if that means facing retaliation from Pak it is justified because it's govt. Is also not crazy they will also face tremendous pressure from USA Russia and even China even before considering a nuclear strike. Now coming to the funds you are going to lose. Respectfully Ma'am no war is a good war and we lose things but sometimes it is necessary to prevent further damage in future like in simple terms its like you face some pain in short term rather than losing a lot in the future. Funds will be lost no denying that but we will have a assurance that in future we will shut their mouths and from the starting the govt. Has so much invested in military that all our battle machines are ready and dont require further costs and we aren't going on a full scale war we are only attacking the terror strongholds in POK and Ma'am that can also be done by from inside india by using Surface to Surface missile strikes!
