As damage control, she followed up this awful rant with sensible posts of army wives' that she knew everyone will agree with. And tried to portray that she was only trying to call out fake nationalism and war mongerers. But that was far from the truth, as can be seen on her IGTV rant.  When questioned by followers on the original post, on how she could trivialise the death of our soldiers by comparing them to everyday deaths, she completely went on a tangent, evaded the questions completely, and went on to make random statements about their death being a failiure of intelligence etc. As the daughter and granddaughter of Air Force Pilots, of course I also believe that war mongering is wrong, targeting Muslims or Kashmiris is pathetic, or simply pretending to be a patriot and caring about the martyrs whilst being terrible citizens in your day to day is wrong, but the other points she made like triviliazing the deaths of the braves who were blown to shreds, is something that is beyond awful.  It is because of what she terms as 'keyboard nationalism' that bharat ke veer has been able to raise over 46 crores for this cause. Just like social media outrage helped the #metoo movement gain international momentum, it has also helped the cause of our brave martyred soldiers. So yes, nationalism of any kind, anywhere, sans hate speech towards any sections, is GOOD. She needs to stop propagating the idea that displaying patriotism altogether is 'uncool' and is only for 'uneducated' people.  Nationalists or Patriots can be educated, pro-Muslim, anti-war, anti-hindutva, sensible people too.  Also, according to what she stated in the first minute of her video, no one should ever mourn, since people die everyday na.
