There's no need of making fun of people who YOU think are lame, disgusting etc. Don't like tiktok? Don't like a particular person on tiktok? Don't watch, move on. If those people who you commented on would come to do the same, I am sure they will get 100 more reasons to get back at you. 2. Now I don't even want to explain whats wrong with your comments about people dying. Because I know, you won't get it. In short, sometimes you just have to shut up and let the world be, let things fall into place slowly and settle down. The time and space that you chose to let out your comments was not appropriate at all. And no, I value a soldier's life more than anyone else, because like me and you he could have also gone for a corporate job or start making lame tik rok roasts on his insta ID. But when he joined the army he knew what he was signing up for.
