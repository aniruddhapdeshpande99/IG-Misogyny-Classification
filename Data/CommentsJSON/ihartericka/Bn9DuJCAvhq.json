I think our society sells a narrative that conception/pregnancy/motherhood are all the most natural things a woman can do and so they come naturally and simply and elegantly. It took 2 years and dozens of invasive tests for me to get pregnant and then it was gone. I think I almost mourned the loss of that idyllic narrative as much as the loss of the baby. When I got pregnant again, I was so afraid and sad and still grieving. And then I had my baby and spent months trying to connect and feel that lightning bolt of love everyone tells you you\u2019re supposed to feel. I realize now that my love for my child came like my love for my husband. It built as I got to know my baby as a person and now 2 years later, he is the light of my life. Anyway, I take that day every year to remind myself that letting go of narratives, letting go of the \u201cshould,\u201d is painful and in its own way a death.
