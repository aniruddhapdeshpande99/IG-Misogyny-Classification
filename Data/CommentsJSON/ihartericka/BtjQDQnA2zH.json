It could be due to my privilege which is why I\u2019m sensitive to the matter, but I take issue with the idea that \u201chood culture\u201d is owned by the black community exclusively. I think geography and the history of diversity in urban areas might suggest a different narrative around this. I\u2019m from NYC, born and raised in a diverse, mixed race family and community. Since the 1970s, My family lived in nearly ever hood that has contributed to \u201chood culture\u201d through the evolution of hiphop, fashion, comedy, television, etc. (Think South Bronx, South-side BK, Flatbush, Coney Island, Jamaica) I think the evolution of hiphop narrowly, but effectively is a good example for how \u201chood culture\u201d is defined overtime. I think it is often forgot the contributions of NBPOC to the creation and development of hiphop. It\u2019s root in blues (black), Rock and Roll (black), but also in Caribbean music (not always black). I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand why those contributions shouldn\u2019t be celebrated and if that is the culture you were born into, why shouldn\u2019t you be able to proudly claim that and how can you be expected to disconnect from that part if your culture?", "reytaino809": "Agree with all of this.
