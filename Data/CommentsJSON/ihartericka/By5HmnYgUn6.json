Next, you said small private donations are not reparations, but go on to ask for money from \"white people\" in general. Which some might consider an \"individual isolated donation\". Again we see the hypocrisy. You did not ask for a rally in support for the black community, you asked for essentially everything that you do not consider a reparation. This is an almost comical post. If you really want change maybe ask people to support more black businesses, etc. Rallying people together is typically a better way to achieve your goals than saying, \"Hey white people give me your money for something you had absolutely nothing to do with and no control over, but like, a person you have never met and is distantly related to you was a piece of shit so, let's see the check hunni\".
