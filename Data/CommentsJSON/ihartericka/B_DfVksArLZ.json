Growing up hard of hearing, I felt like I never belonged. I belonged at college. Because of COVID 19, I had to pack my life up abruptly and move back home, in order to finish a semester of college, online. Seems awesome? No it is not. My sister and her two young children are in my room, and I have no place to call my own. My dad is a custodian at the Veterans Hospital and cleans the rooms of COVID 19 patients. He goes to work everyday with the possibility of contracting it and spreading it to us. As a 19 year old college student who was NOT eligible for the stimulus check, I feel that I am deserving of something because my life changed abruptly and I am struggling mentally, financially because of it. I lost my source of income. I had to make storage and travel accommodations with money I did not have. My story is not so different from other college students around the world. RIT/NTID was my sanctuary. I could get my hearing aids fixed for a cheaper price and now I have to pay to request a visit to see my doctor then pay again if I were to see them. Thank you so much for hearing my story and I hope you realize that students matter too!
