Narrow this down. 2 - This is situational. Deadnames aren\u2019t exactly bad to use, but that really is dependent on the person and not on the condition of them being trans. Not exactly correct here. 3 - Okay, uh. No. Mean spirited use, maybe, but it actually does take time for us \u201ccis\u201d to adhere to a new pronoun.

Don\u2019t get offended just because a close friend forgot how the new you prides themself. 4 - Well what if it\u2019s common knowledge?
