Always the same scheme \"black people on one side, white people on the other side\". And this applies to any other conflict, and this is where the world is going wrong. As a gay man, I cannot bear this community effect sought by gay people. As a reminder, the first gay activists fought for equality of sexuality, which means they fought so that no difference would be made between a straight person and a gay one. Now, what we see is the completely opposite situation. We see gay people as a group separated from straight people. They claim for their freedom on behalf of the \"gay community\", community which is an illusion and which is the only gay reality people witness. Hence the gap existing between sexualities is getting wider and wider instead of closing up.
