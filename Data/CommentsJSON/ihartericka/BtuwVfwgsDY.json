Like, how does putting racial restrictions on a word like \u201cthick\u201d result in progress toward a world with real equality? And to dig deeper into one of the replies, if bi-racial folks are not black, can they use the word? What about tri-racial? What percentage of black gives you the right to define yourself as such? 2/3? 1/16?
