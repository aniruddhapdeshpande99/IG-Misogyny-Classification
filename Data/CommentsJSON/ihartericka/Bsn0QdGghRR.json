There was never \"me\" when I was growing up. So that by the time you are an adult, it bothers you that you have space and someone else doesn't. You feel when others are hurting. You ask yourself who hasn't eaten when serving food for yourself. And you don't think that you matter more and so deserve to take from everyone else. I see this attitude that people have about sharing as a lacking. I always tell people, \"you can't teach what you don't know.
