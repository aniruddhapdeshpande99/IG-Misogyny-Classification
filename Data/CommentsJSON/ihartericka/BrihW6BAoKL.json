So people probably assumed my husband is racist or that I was married because I was lighter, and that would make me mad too.

I am what many Latinx like to say,\u201cMorena\u201d not light enough to be considered light skin or dark enough to be called dark skin but still had indigenous features. From 10th grade to 12th grade I was really into this white passing Latinx boy who was my friend. I tried to get him to like me through making him home cooked meals, getting his homework when he was sick (he would get sick a lot) and many other things. I tried asking him out several times but he would reject me. When I tried to move on from him, he would reeled me in by showing a lot of interest me and giving me compliments. He did this for the next 3 years of high school. I got tired of it in my senior year that I stopped talking to him, hanging out with him during lunch, and bringing his homework when he missed school. The following week (after I stopped talking to him), he got with the only white girl in the school. This was a huge blow to my self esteem because it reminded me that no matter what I did for him, was there for him, and knew his deepest secrets, he would never want me: a skinny weird girl with indigenous features.
