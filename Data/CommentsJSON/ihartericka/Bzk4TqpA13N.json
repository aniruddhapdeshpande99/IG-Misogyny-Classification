Yes there are times that I truly love to wear makeup and do art on my face. But there are other times when I want to rip my breasts off and just be 'other', to be a 'drag king' (but not really it was just how I rationalized it) it's very alienating to feel this way. And sexually, I knew I appreciated both genders but hated referring to myself as any lable like 'bi or pan' because I absolutely hate the idea of defining myself as anything so I started to refer to my sexuality as queer and actually came out to my sorority as such my senior year of college, which was scary. And then this past fall I moved to Wisconsin to campaign and organize for the Democratic party and I worked with two wonderful enby people. They were really cool but it was also jarring to me because I've never encountered enby people before and I also felt that referring to their pronouns of 'they/them' was almost othefing and disrespectful. I however worked really hard to break out of that and sometimes I still slip up but I do all I can to respect it. Only recently have I started to identify myself as gender-queer as well because it just makes more sense. I try to use they/them pronouns though I'm not offended if I am reffered to as a she/her. However I also sometimes feel like I don't know how to fit in with this community either. I never want to take up space that isn't mine. And I also sometimes don't assert my identity enough because I don't know really how to, I don't have a dead name, I still at times enjoy my feminity I just sometimes don't know who or what I am. I am privileged and I am white therefore it sometimes feels weird coming out of a closet that I am only half way in, in the first place or that's how I perceive it I guess.
