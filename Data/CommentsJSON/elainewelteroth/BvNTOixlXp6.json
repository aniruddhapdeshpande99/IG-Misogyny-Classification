Lived on friends couches, shared their beds, until I finally moved into an apartment in nyc that illegally housed four people. My mattresses placed on the floor before a friend of mine gave me their old bed frame when they were getting a new one. People in my life told me they\u2019re we\u2019re worried that I would fail, but really, I was feeding my dream of living in nyc and working my way up at a design firm, fulfilling my creative passion that was mildly stifled by my stepparent choosing my college and telling me to study business (which I changed). Then I moved to another city to be with the man I would later marry, try to continue that career, but then made a choice to pivot into fashion styling because I so passionately loved this industry and wanted to explore the powers and impact of helping women dress to feel their best. To light up my dream and push to grow. To help other women seek and find their own power within that I found and continue to tune on my own journey. And now, all of that is yielding growth and pride.
