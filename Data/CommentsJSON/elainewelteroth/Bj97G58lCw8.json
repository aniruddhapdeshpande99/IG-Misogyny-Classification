They do not do it intentionally often that they start mansplaining stuff without having asked for their opinion but they do not even think that they might have internalized some biased thinking. So it's good to have your back up, your girls and colleagues who are cool with u being confident. It will help with feeling frustration. Talking bout your thoughts and feelings is also key.

None of them graduated high school. My brothers and sisters and I are the first in our entire family to go to college and graduate. Which was the reason why my parents left Congo in the first place. So I find this iniative inspiring as well as important. Foremost because everyone should have access to an education but also because you never know where your education can take you guys.
