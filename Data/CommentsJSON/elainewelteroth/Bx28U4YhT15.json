I think I will save just to buy a few copies in hopes to encourage some young ladies I serve and minister to here in #Indy who behave and express they aren't #morethanenough and believe they don't deserve better than the struggles they are currently in. Oh the sad stories I could tell... Knowing a little about you, knowing your sweet Mom, loving Jonathan, I look forward to reading your book and using it to help empower, inspire, encourage some of these young ladies I'm trying to speak life and transformation into their lives. #TheyMatterToo and are #MoreThanEnough. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd for them to believe it for themselves. Blessings and continued best wishes on your journey. Kisses to my @jonathansingletary. I'll buy a copy soon. \ud83d\udc9c", "divineone7": "@luvli_lmack", "theheaddressworkshop": "@mannequinmadness Already bought my ticket to your upcoming talk at the commonwealth club in SF.
