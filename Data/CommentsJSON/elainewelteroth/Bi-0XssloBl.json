It was less about the \u201croyal family\u2019s\u201d acceptance, and all about the Queen\u2019s opinion because she is honestly in charge. Since Prince William has three children, and it is highly unlikely that Prince Harry would ever take the throne \u2013 it\u2019s likely that the Queen would have accepted a darker complexed woman. For example, look up the royal family from Liechtenstein and Princess Angela who also married to the second son, and they had a biracial son \u2013 who is in line to that throne. Also, look up Alexandra, a Countess (lost her Princess title due to the divorce) \u2013 married the second son of the Danish royal family, and they had two multiracial sons \u2013 who are in line to that throne. Finally, there is Prince Albert II of Monaco\u2026look up his son Alexandre Grimaldi-Coste. Nevertheless, back to Meghan\u2026we know that her beautiful African-American mother has been embraced. She\u2019s not going anywhere \u2013 well, maybe back to California until the grandkids begin to arrive. She is also part of the royal family. Regardless of how Meghan looks today, Harry and Meghan will likely have children with various features \u2013 all beautiful. I believe the message from Bishop Curry was \u2013 it\u2019s all about love, and that we\u2019re all part of the same family\u2026even if we don\u2019t always behave as if that\u2019s true. His speech was certainly a pleasant highlight.

The reason for erasure is that race and racism are based on the construction of whiteness and the privileging of white identity. My African ancestors recognized that we do not choose our ancestors and so should recognize all our kin. Yet no matter that I know my ancestry includes Wampanoag, Tauxenant, Irish, and possibly German as well as sub-Saharan African \u2014 no matter the lightness of my skin tone and that it signals mixed race ancestry \u2014 society sees \u201cBlack.\u201d And the reality is that culturally I am Black and American, even while embracing the \u201cAfrican\u201d American label. My cultural orientation is Western Hemisphere. I acknowledge and honor the complexity and nuance of identity and ask why whatever the identity our greater society cannot respect it all as humanity? At the core of this conundrum is a hegemony that elevates the superiority of one social identity or identities (race, ethnicity, gender identity , nationality, sexual orientation, sex, religion, socioeconomic condition) over a marginalized and oppressed other. This may sound political, but for me it is a spiritual evil to which I commit to being in the words of Rev.
