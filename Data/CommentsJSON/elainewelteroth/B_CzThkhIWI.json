Last year after nearly 5 yrs of therapy for grieving the loss of my only child, I found out I had breast cancer and decided what I needed most In The World was to hear my own voice. My therapist was amazing, I am eternally grateful for everything we worked on together, but in order to know the best path forward, for me, I had to get rid of all the voices except my own. I\u2019ve been getting free ever since, it is a process that your book parallels for me so poignantly it looks like my own narration. I can see how hard you\u2019ve worked and how far you\u2019ve come and I know what it takes to get there and to not go back \u270a\ud83c\udffd", "mmmmkaaaayyyy": "The TRUTH!!!
