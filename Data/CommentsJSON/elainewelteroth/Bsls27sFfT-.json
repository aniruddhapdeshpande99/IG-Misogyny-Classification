Unfortunately, this statement has been said pointing fingers at a white run police and legal system. Saying that \u201cthey\u201d didn\u2019t value our young black girls. But the ugly truth is we (the black community) didn\u2019t either. Many people from Chicago have told the stories of him frequenting the malls, high schools, McDonald\u2019s looking for young girls and that this was well known, yet his music was still blasting on Chicago airwaves, his concerts still selling out, he was still being invited to our churches. Decades of this, countless young black bodies. And we stood by silently. But quick to defend him and place blame on the victims. How is it so difficult to not support this monster? To reject his music? A black girl is not worth the $1.29 you paid to download one of his singles? People question why they didn\u2019t come forward earlier- why would they? We knew the stories.
