I am a British, Gujarati Indian but have no freedom and am very isolated, damaged, and a victim of many hardships including racist attacks even from police who of course face no consequences. I am 24,but not developed, not graduates, not employed, not driving, not free, not married, not active, not travelled, not clued up, not on par eitj ym peers, especially successful Indians. I'm oversharing all this because if any indian girl or woman sees this and complains about their stereotypical Indian upbringing, and complains about petty things, I want them to be grateful that they have working, helpful, caring, skilled, well rounded, parents and big supportive families and you get to go to all those cool weddinga, samaj meetings etc. I was given an english name by my uneducated, pathetic father who is now 90 and so abusive still, and I recently changed it to a stereotypical indian womans name by deed poll and getting it signed by a solicitor after years of torment and being challenged in rude manners about why some 'ugly indian' as me has such a 'pretty english name'.Post like this on social media make me smile so much like you wouldn't believe but also bittersweet as in reality, I'll never be able to relate & my life is world's apart however I adore Deepica and her products look incredible and I genuinely do love the expressions shown here & the aesthetics of the whole gender reveal setup. I'm not sharing to be a negative nancy. I just want t educate peopel hether theyre Gujaratis like me or lucky white folk, that not all Indians have the same upbringings and privileges.
