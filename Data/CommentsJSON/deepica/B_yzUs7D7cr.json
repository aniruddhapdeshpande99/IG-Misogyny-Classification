We are eight years apart. I am the baby of my house. Growing up everybody used to compare our skin tones and talk openly about how beautiful my sister is and how lucky she is for her lighter skin tone. I always thought i was the uggo of my house. When i was about 5 years old I remember My sister telling me that \u2018people who are born dark become lighter after growing up and people who are born lighter get darker growing up\u2019 just to make me happy. She used to fight with her friends and cut ties with anyone who compared our skin tones. She always used to protect me. At age 10 i was convinced that i could never be beautiful and i would rather be successful to have a chance in this society, so I studied hard and kept sailing through comments about my skin tone. I was told that i have really good features and if only my skin was lighter i had a chance in life. Imagine hearing these sort of comments at a tender age of 5 or 6. It sure is the worst trauma for a little girl. When i turned 18 i had a lot of boys following me around. I never understood what they saw in me because i was convinced that i was ugly. I moved to the US at 21 and white men asked me out for dates and i slowly started to realize that I wasn\u2019t ugly and my color was not a barrier for my beauty. I has this sudden aura of realization that dark is beautiful too. That was my little story growing up. Watching this video brought back my childhood memories. Indian society is harsh on darker skin tones specially for women. When i was in India last summer i was looking to buy a simple moisturizer in a market. To my horror every product in the market including soaps were \u2018fairness\u2019 enhancing. Really frustrating to see that. Pretty sure there are thousands of little girls who are already convinced that they are ugly just because they are dark. This has to stop. I love how live tinted represents all shades of beauty.

I even left a highly reputed school and move to a private school because everyday I was called charcoal and dusters were being blown on my face (pretending they didn\u2019t see me since i was dark) as well as being rejected for being a cheerleader for sports days as a girl came up and told me I am dark and not beautiful to do so. I had even just posted my experience on a post in my account about all these. And all these led to me having Red Skin today because I used steroid creams to get fairer.
