I didn't really have a problem before but now due to hormonal changes Ive looking like a bit of a gorilla for the last few years. I used to wax as threading was wayyyy to painful for me. I did stop all kind of hair removal for about 2 years whilst at uni after having a bad experience with a lady burning parts of my face with hot wax and not even saying sorry. Over the last month I've been feeling reallyyy self conscious about my peach fuzz and got it waxed after so long. And my skin reacted (I have very sensitive skin) and within 2 weeks I had to go back to get the hair removed coz it was growing back and at a quicker rate. I got it threaded this time (about a week ago) my whole face and neck area and my God the pain! And my face is still sensitive from it. I am getting lil spots and my face and it is all bumpy from where the hair has been removed from the root (so not a nice sight when u put makeup on coz the skin isn't as smooth as it usually is). But Im determined to get it done regularly despite the pain and the after effects in the hopes my skin will become less sensitive and my peach fuzz will grow back less.
