It's hard to explain why I am still on the edge when the threat of being attacked by the number of men I have pissed off in my life is a thing of the past. Why I am moving my can of pepper spray with me from my car to my house. It was hard to explain to my friend while we were camping and some people who knew me saw us pitching our tent up there, why I was stiffing up everytime I heard a footstep or a branch crack, ehu couldn't sleep all night. Our lives are always spent under the shadow of an immediate threat to our lives. Everytime I am scared of something like this the only thing that keeps me sane is that can of pepper spray and my husband's company and that is a pretty fucking shitty existence. Everytime I hear/read that women are most likely to be killed or raped by someone they know, I clutch my can of pepper spray tighter, I plan out a million escape routes in my head and distrust every man who I know has the power to hurt me in the back of my head. That's one of the reasons I cannot wait to get old enough that no one would want to hurt me, call out after me, rape and kill me. Thank you Regha for writing this.
