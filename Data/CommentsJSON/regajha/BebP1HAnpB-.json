This particular post actually brought tears to my eyes coz of the immense and hard truth it held.. I speak for myself when I say that sooo many times I feel I lead a meaningless life. Nothing new happens.. I sit n smile n laugh n be cheerful but CANNOT show my sadness or pain outside.. I feel a pressure coz everybody knows me as this \"happy-go-lucky\", extrovert person n I feel like I have to carry out this facade for them n for me coz showing any other emotion would act as a betrayal..
