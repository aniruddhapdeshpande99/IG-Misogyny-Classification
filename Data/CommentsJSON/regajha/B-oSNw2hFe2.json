On the other bright side, our PM knows the seriousness of the pandemic at hand (hence the country wide lockdown) as opposed to many other countries\u2019 leaders who just denied the seriousness upfront. Can we even imagine the mammoth-ness of the decision to lockdown or not weighed against what will happen to certain sections of community and the economy at large? I can\u2019t even fathom the number of things to evaluate before making decisions for an entire country. Our country\u2019s population is such that there\u2019s always groups of people hating those decisions. But given that the issue is at hand is that of survival - our very basic instinct to survive, let\u2019s all be nice to each other so we get through. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "jus_sneha": "influencers being so negative for our own nation!! if nothing spread love!", "varsha_kumarijhala": "You can hate the government not the country.

Every human is. But in this case, distracted from what? I hope you know that the lockdown will be extended. It is needed. But here's the catch, it's not so easy for everyone to understand and grasp that fact. People will need to stay inside for more time. And this more time is indefinite right now. As an Indian, you must know how difficult it is to keep 1.3 billion Indians under discipline with sincere instructions to follow. With so many people frustrated from being able to do nothing, I see this 'distraction' as only a positive act of hope, and there should be no wrong intention attached to it. Moreover, when it's about our country's preparedness for the pandemic, I think we are taking the right steps at the right time. The foremost being attempting to limit the spread that comes along with a big tradeoff of slowed down economy. It could be my lack of information but honestly, I haven't seen articles/complaints from doctors/policemen that they are not getting enough support from the government. The only thing this whole world needs right now is to slow this down. Slow this down, so that the available medical facilities shall never get overwhelmed by the number of patients to treat. So that no such person dies who could have been treated and recovered just because there is no bed. What we should be focussing on is, keeping calm, supporting the govt's actions, staying interested in life, following the real instructions, and all this while continue to improve and increase the healthcare facilities so that the overwhelming situation may never arise. If you really have questions into masks availability for doctors and other healthcare equipments, do check out the Ministry of Health Welfare updates on their website. Stop blaming the PM for everything. Even the best of the countries (will all the money and technology) are unable to cope up, and they don't even have to handle citizens who would garba during the lockdown. So please, instead of spreading words that will only make people question their faith in the govt. and its instructions, convince them somehow to stay in.", "justexpressyourselffreely": "\u0915\u0902\u092e\u0947\u0902\u091f\u094d\u0938 \u092a\u0922 \u0915\u0930 \u0932\u0917\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u092e\u0948 \u0917\u0932\u0924\u0940 \u0938\u0947 Republic bharat \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u0947\u091c \u092a\u0947 \u0906\u0917\u092f\u093e \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "aritreeh": "You are stating a fact.
