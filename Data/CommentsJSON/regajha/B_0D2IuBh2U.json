And as a matter of fact, there are incidents where men too become the prey of the opposite gender. But most of the times these are unheard of. Taking an example of the sad incident that happend with Sarvjeet Singh. Although it is old, but it is a very good example of the fact that \"not always men are wrong\". And yes, many boys like me are very much kind and respectful to opposite gender because we have been taught the right way.
