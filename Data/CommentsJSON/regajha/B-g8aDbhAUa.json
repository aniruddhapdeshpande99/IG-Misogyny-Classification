We\u2019re being forced to shut the external and the outside to go within to hunt down the faith - the faith in a higher power working for us, with us. In some twisted, fated, magical and mysterious way. To only bring a new, a new wave or a new world order. To renew our very selves so we can renew all that is around us and was so long ignored. It takes a tragedy of this scale to reinforce human connection. We are forced to be off grid so we value what true human intimacy is and don\u2019t take it for granted. That hug, that kiss or that random strangers gesture. When we truly truly truly believe that the higher power is all there is to everything and that we are insane to hustle in this capitalist fatalistic world which only breeds on consumerism - can we fix it.

It really made me cognizant of how all good things in my life are potentially anxiety inducing, and that's why I'm scared to put myself out there or do new and challenging things.
