Few names that are continuously popping up are very true. Whatever I am going to say below while pointing fingers to the audience INCLUDES ME TOO. I am also a culprit behind making them famous. Lets start with Debasree- She takes all the promotions that comes her way and now she can afford to buy (read already bought) a Chanel 3 lacs bag. She personally can financed international trips with influencer money (only people would understand this who had been seeing her since inception days and her Q&A sessions.. it was clear she wasn't from a super rich background. Social media helped her). Moving on from fake skincare promotions she does, in what way her make up skills are good???? That too gets featured in Allure. None of the Allure people saw Saloni Mathur, Smitha Deepak, Shreya Jain??? That's not all Allure's problem because of that freaking COSMOPOLITAN had PRESENTED HER WITH AN AWARD this year for doing NOTHING partly based in our votes. (I haven't voted any of them but I am still accounting myself for the mishap). That award totally changed her vlogging game and we are responsible for that. Those so called influencers are coming out laughing from their banks because of that shitty award. Now bnbcloset had also started the trend so if anybody wins that will be on votes aka.. again our fault. Ankita (Corallista)- Doesn't know shit about hardcore MakeUp. Always plays with safer Colors.. haven't seen her doing a single cut crease. Total sell outs... Nykaa's robot. She selects her Q&A mostly of James and how they met. It's getting irritating (unfollowed her btw) Malvika- She has a modelling career to fall back upon but we all know she wont coz of the Cosmopolitan award. Again. We are taking a bowl of popcorn and sitting in front of our laptops watching Sunday with Malz. But let's be real playing with Colors Fushia and royal blue and making dramatic eyes with 'newly launched Nykaa gel eyeliner' does not make one a makeup artist.

I can tell by the comments that most of the blame is being put on influencers. I think the brands need to take some responsibility too. By showing that they are paying people to talk about their stuff. Someday the bad quality of their products will catch up to them. For eg, for every launch that @nykaabeauty does, atleast 10-15 influencers post about how much they love this launch. In the beginning, we fell for it and ended up buying some stuff.

I too have been baffled so many times seeing some influencers talking about a different beauty or makeup product each day. How do you know something is good or bad in one use?? Viewers too are blindly purchasing these products without thinking how this will affect their skin or hair, or not knowing the damage it can cause in the long run. I urge everyone to do proper research, read blogs as they share detailed reviews along with pros and cons, and most importantly know yourself, your skin, your hair, your body.", "komaljiofficial": "Woho!!!! \ud83d\ude18", "babiesbymyside_prachi.c": "Finally u said it..

I know you do ( personal experience of speaking with you) but brands are copying content, products, packaging, hell even campaign but each and every blogger is promoting it left right and centre while they have prompted the original of it as well.

About your commenting on @mrjovitageorge - I would beg to disagree on some aspects. I have asked her on many accounts, when she\u2019s promoted Huda\u2019s eyeshadows that have come out with warning as \u201cnot fit for eyes\u201d or asked her why would she hark on her values when addressing the \u201cbrown girl\u201d unfriendly Lakme MU but still endorse LIFW, and go promote their brand - she has been quiet. I have asked, not chastised. Tried to understand the change of heart but to date I haven\u2019t heard. So I would also say, Jovita\u2019s MU vids are great happy trippy stuff for inspo. Trust, I wouldn\u2019t take it that far.. not from what I have seen in the past few months, unfortunately.

I think people who have huge number of followers should keep away from giving out weight loss,acne and dandruff dealing methods.These are conditions that need medical supervision and putting up random products or routines or what worked for one as the gold standard is not at all ethical and safe. Also a problem is giving out diy skin care products without proper understanding. Anything and everything natural, naturally derived doesn\u2019t mean its safe and efficacious to use. So also many products cannot just be made with a bowl n whisk, store it in a bottle n refrigerate. Highly unsafe. As you rightly said, one cannot cause harm to another just by claims n non-researched, non-tested stuff. Many of these diy stuff get bad even if staying in the fridge or whatever and the colony of bacteria, fungi, mold, yeast cannot be seen by naked eye, can cause serious health problems", "aa.living\nVerified": "Verified", "bajaj_cheshta": "Spent good 20 minutes watching some really good stuff.
