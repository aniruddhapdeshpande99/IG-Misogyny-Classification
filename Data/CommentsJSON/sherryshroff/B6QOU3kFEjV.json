When these nations mentioned are all Islamic nations having no secularism, so isn't it logical that their minority would be non muslim and needs help!! Is India that developed a country that we can accept anyone?? At least we are trying to help these refugees by giving citizenship, and even Muslims of these places can get citizenship by naturalization of 11 years.", "nikki.ca.in": "CAA is a govt political agenda to grant citizenship to \u201cpersecuted minorities from 3 countries\u201d .It isn't discriminatory. NRC is a SC mandated executive exercise which is aimed at identifying \u201call illegal immigrants\u201d( despite of their religion)It is a legitimate fear in many eastern border districts that immigration has altered demography so much that Indian citizens are no longer in majority or will lose majority of things stand as they are. CAA+NRC isn't going to benefit any one group of voters. The need to give citizenship to persecuted minorities has been bipartisan. I can't see why anyone would stand against that. CAA is only for people who has migrated before 2014 , they are already in our country ,country is already spending money on them. 2) about NRC in Assam I would just say that search for number that how many illegals immigrants has migrated in last few years , it\u2019s not threat to any religion but it\u2019s threat to the citizens of the state - not having a single document is not justified excuse - you can still bring two witnesses in your favour for verdicts .  so called Educated People who have had read the act carefully wouldn\u2019t have mislead people on the streets in name of religion . this is creating hate and chaos , don\u2019t they understand how they are impacting country\u2019s economy now ? These people either hate current government ( like you )or they haven\u2019t understand the reason behind these acts. Again it\u2019s not discrimination to any religion it\u2019s act for \u201cpersecuted minorities\u201d !

That's why Muslim migrants are excluded. and other religions mentioned in the act(hindu, Christian, parsi, jains, Buddhists.. ) are a minority there. If they are ill treated there and wants to reside in India, this act provides just that. By bringing some changes to the citizenship act.

FYI: North east people fought for NRC( which is meant to deport illegal migrants irrespective of religion) both Caa and NRC are different. North East people are protesting because they fear if migrants are allowed to stay in India with this act. But No, the CAA is a separate law and NRC is a separate process.
