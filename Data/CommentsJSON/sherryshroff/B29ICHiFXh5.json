Secondly, from the reviews I have read it is suppose to be very good for reducing pores. My skin has been experiencing pore enlargement \ud83d\ude1e. Thirdly, I have heard the COSRX snail cream is cruelty free. The snails are not harmed while collecting their secretion.

So they\u2019re in no way injured or killed in the procedure. Lastly, since it\u2019s an all in one cream it would be great for a lazy human like me.
