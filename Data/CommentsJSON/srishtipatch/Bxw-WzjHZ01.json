I too suffer from periodic eating disorders, sporadic anxiety attacks, and crazy seasons of fluctuating insecurity, but as a performer when I saw you, Sonia and the other girls on Buzzfeed I was extremely encouraged. People like true talent. They laugh with real wit. They sync with authentic presentations. So no, don't give up. Be yourself, and keep on being an encouragement to women like myself.
