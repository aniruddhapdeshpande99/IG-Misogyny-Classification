People need to stop this practice of invading one's dignity and reducing one's self to that of only a sexualised ideal, we are all guilty of feeding said beast but if we stop objectifying people and start looking at them solely for their talent or voice then I think society and the world would be such a better place. I hope this idea rings true, Carrie Fisher joked about it on the documentary Wishful Drinking that George Lucas owned the rights to her likeness and I believe that if you could somehow make it illegal for paparazzi to take these images it would very much change the world for the better.", "terrytoccidesigns": "Stunning!", "annavacuum": "Insanely gorgeous \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99", "kendo8714": "You look stunning.
