I was \"lucky enough\" last week to get detailed to guard an Access Control Point 0600-1800.

Watching these posts inspired me to ask, not only \"have you coughed,\" but-for example-\"what is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow?\" You inspired me to brighten my day and make an assortment of frowning soldiers and spouses laugh.
