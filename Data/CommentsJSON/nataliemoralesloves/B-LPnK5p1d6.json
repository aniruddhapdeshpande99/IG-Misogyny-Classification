It was one of the first thing I read aloud to children, far too fast and very nervous. I now read to children at least twice a week (in a much calmer fashion). I've been a bit embarrassed to read it again since that first attempt, but I think you fixed it for me. It was nice to hear it again and remember why it's such an important book to share.", "arianaxcat": "aww i love your chonky cat \ud83d\udc08 i have 3 cats they are my life \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\ude3b"}
