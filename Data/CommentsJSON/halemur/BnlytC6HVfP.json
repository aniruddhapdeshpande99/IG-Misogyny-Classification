Two weeks ago my favorite jeans ripped and I was totally fine with it. I didn\u2019t feel guilty, nor blamed my gaining weight for it. They just weren\u2019t my size anymore, and that was ok. And part of this unconscious triumph (the acceptance of my own fluctuating body) had to do with a piece you wrote for Man Repeller a while ago. It was about not wearing smaller, tight, skinny jeans anymore because they made you feel like your body wasn\u2019t right for the jeans, when in fact it was the exact opposite.
