I asked her where it was from and she said \u201cAmazon\u201d and I immediately pulled out my phone so she could verify the purchase. I loved wearing it, but after a few months, it felt too heavy, like wearing a weighted blanket. It was even worse if I found myself having to hold it at a bar. I eventually gave it away and went back to my old standard black down coats, which, although less fashionable, were far better made and less of a burden. I do sometimes see it on people and remember how much I loved it in the moment, which is a fun memory to have, without still having to own it.", "pucasabina": "Soooo to buy or not to buy? \ud83e\udd14", "williamandwest": "I love this coat so much!

I too had a similar experience when the clunky Tiffany heart bracelet first came out. I thought I was the cats meow and then everyone seemed to have one.
