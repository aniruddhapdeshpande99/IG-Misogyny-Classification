I could only bite my lips in front of them. Because tyrants they are. Sitting on a throne They paid through their noses for. A throne bought by blood. Never needing the people's choice. Birds of passage Their promises are. When they speak They leave much to be desired. Yet their scandals Nipped in the bud. When they need something from us. They show us cupboard love. Bring them to book! Oh! mother justice. Because they have refused to turn a new leaf. Call their bluff!. Oh! Mother justice. For we have girdled our loins. Let the cat out of the bag! Oh! Mother justice.
