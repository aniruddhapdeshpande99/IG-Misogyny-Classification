It ended on September 23, 1886 after more than 16 years of fierce battle fought day and night, on the ground and in the water, on the high and low places, on mountains, valleys and plain fields. In the afternoon of September 23, the warring sides, Ibadan and Ekiti Parapo signed a truce in Lagos. One man stood out in this whole campaign for peace on the path of war trodden. His name was Ogedengbe. He was a man of principle who devoted his lifetime to military exploits, war tactics, the procurement of arms, the design of war weapons and also the diligent pursuit of beautiful women. Ogedengbe was said to be a tall, handsome man with the eyes of an owl, shifting from one corner to the other and the sight of which awed his foes and friends alike. Ogedengbe had earlier enlisted in the Ibadan military academy in 1800s where he had years of training as a young Ijesa boy who loved and sought adventures. He had his training in military intelligence, decoy, military spirituality, infantry and the art of unarmed combat. Fate was to place a huge responsibility on him in later years. When the Kiriji war started, Ekiti had no standing army and was expected to face a large and organized Ibadan military machine, perhaps one of the best ever seen in Africa with about 150,000 soldiers, a prosperous economy, a sound experience of warfare backed with a retinue of military weapons including those imported from Europe. Ibadan was so sophisticated that the British had to delay incursion to the Yorubaland for fear of defeat and even humiliation. KIRIJI The fist battle was disastrous for Ekiti. The people nicknamed the battle \u201cOgun Jalumi\u201d what the English would call the Battle of Waterloo. Ekiti had little experience in naval war and her soldiers ended up beaten and destroyed by Ibadan naval platoons. Ekiti had to reorganise. The Fabunmi, probably in the rank of a Brigadier and Faboro, probably of the rank of a Brigadier held series of meetings and made plans. But Ibadan was too gracious in battle and dreadfu", "sweegdeddy": "Wow \u2764\ufe0f", "nelydaja": "\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f", "lachysword": "Fine like Wine from South of France \u2728", "beltraolarissa": "Quero uma camiseta dessa! \u2764", "hayleyod1": "@amykatetrevor \ud83d\udc99", "giovannakordei1": "Just like your T-shirt says...Iconic, strong-willed and fearless! @chimamanda_adichie \ud83d\udc96", "deborahikhenoba": "Beautiful lady", "shudes9478": "\ud83d\ude0d\u2665\ufe0f", "mafiakowe": "My favorite personality", "betterbodiesll": "Yes, in order to identify with someone you have to identify with yourself first!", "owanyaxinene": "\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "loizchat1": "Lovely", "kezaya_": "I just love you. @chimamanda_adichie", "everichotj_store": "The women who should be standing up for feminism are carrying their loads of family problems to any man that say hi in Nigeria.
