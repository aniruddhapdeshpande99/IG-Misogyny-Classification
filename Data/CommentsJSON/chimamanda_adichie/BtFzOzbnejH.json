However Achebe being an Igbo man diffused the fear of what the boss will say with special reference to the British who he diplomatically and also openly critiqued especially in \u201c Things fall Apart\u201d and other books . He also wrote about the evil of the northerners in Nigeria . This was even when freedom of speech was like one sitting on the gun powder in the military regime. Achebe has been considered controversial because of his brevity in speaking out the truth. Few days ago watching \u201cuniversity challenge \u201c on BBC here in the Uk and seeing a question in Achebe\u2019s picture , I was happen and proud of my Igbo heritage but I paused and asked why he never received any prominent award . Well Soyinka has a lot to do .
