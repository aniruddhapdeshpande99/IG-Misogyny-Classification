Love endures with patience and serenity, love is kind and thoughtful, and is not jealous or envious; love does not brag and is not proud or arrogant. It is not rude; it is not self-seeking, it is not provoked [nor overly sensitive and easily angered]; it does not take into account a wrong endured. It does not rejoice at injustice, but rejoices with the truth [when right and truth prevail]. Love bears all things [regardless of what comes], believes all things [looking for the best in each one], hopes all things [remaining steadfast during difficult times], endures all things [without weakening]. 1 CORINTHIANS 13:3\u202d-\u202c7", "mosope_may": "@shally_oye @_oyebola_ dare to TAKE \u2764\ufe0f", "glicerdavel": "@thommylsossai", "laura_marchenat": "\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\ude0d", "adigunmide": "\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "toribenneth": "Can't stop watching this\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25", "conscioushoney": "Get your 100% Pure Honey from A Beekeeper #buyoriginal #Stay healthy \ud83d\udc1d \ud83d\udc1d \ud83d\udc1d \ud83c\udf6f \ud83c\udf6f \ud83c\udf6f", "mashibe": "\ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udfaf", "swimbikerunae": "\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "1nafi": "@nyangs_rouge_studio", "zahra79nazari": "\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96", "layseramalho": "Eu te amo mulher", "aneetah_mayrie": "\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c", "king_odia": "Legend. \ud83d\udd25", "beladimchi": "I'm an Alpha Female I wouldn't want it any other way. \ud83d\udc51", "nayaamendy": "\ud83d\udda4", "haidy_oa": "Yeah you're right about that small voice\ud83e\udd14 I will dare to take!", "kinggift_____": "Dare to take\ud83d\udc4c", "sefe_yankee_": "\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4c\u2764\ufe0f", "juanitaeuka": "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udfff", "tayfigueiredo": "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc", "itsjustekky": "@nezenjeze", "msrachelhollis\nVerified": "Verified", "cperrylaperledorrare": "@sideways8_ @olivechristie._ \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe", "francesorjiudoka": "Love you forever", "ogdoua": "Oh Chimamanda \u2764\ufe0f", "moji.dayodunmoye": "Gbammmmm!!!!!!", "lamujerbruja": "@disagio @yayafxf", "eghosita": "\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe", "she.dazzles": "\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0d", "king_galahard": "\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "perrydhot": "\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\u2764", "sweet_ness_teaga": "Your voice was made to reach people \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd", "vikky_x_": "#happyinternationalwomensday \ud83d\udc9c", "fridapain_": "\u2764\ufe0f", "_lolalose": "\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff.
