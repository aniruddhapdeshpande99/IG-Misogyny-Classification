One thing you must know is that the Igbo people either tell a lot of lies or half Truth about the civil war.You need to also listen to the yorubas and the Hausa's who were alive and even participated n the war to get a complete story, instead of this half Truth, which your humble self is against, you have believed over the years.Thank God you can access a truthful compatriots like Prof Wole Soyinka, who was one of those who risked his life to the Enemy side(Biafra) to convince Ojukwu to step down on the war but he refused! Were you told that the Igbo fired the 1st shot? And Whoever fires the 1st shot in an act of war matters- this means you called for it.This means you started what you could not finish. Even the Bible says ' he that sows the wind will reap whirl wind\".Chief obafemi Awolowo that most Igbo people hated also risked his life to the enemy's side to convince ojukwu not to go ahead with his declaration of war but he vehemently refused! Are you now staying that these people would have folded their hands and allowed the Biafra to run their people over when Biafra started killing the Yoruba's in Ore(a Yoruba land)? If the Enemy's properties were not ceased like you have complainer how would you have known there is war? What's called war in the first place. 2 people were fighting like an adage says, one bit the other with teeth, the one bitten with teeth started complaining that he was beaten with it; doesn't he know that teeth biting is part of fight? The way you have portrayed the entire issue over the years has been seriously lopsided.
