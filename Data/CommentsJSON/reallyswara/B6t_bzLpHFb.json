They need to make a future for themselves b4 they become d future of this country. A lot of them come with huge responsibilities of taking care of their families. They need to study hard, get a degree n a job 1st. Sadly today..this section of our society is being used by political activists for their selfish motives. They r being distracted from their goals, n studies into politics. Poor parents sacrifice everything to give their children better education. But instead of studying these student r joining politics, beating each other up, letting down not just their parents, but also their country. & these politicians who use them for propoganda r to be blamed for brainwshing them! They're too young to b involved in politics. There's a right time for it. But not when they're in college. So pls..i appeal to u, DONT drag students in political issues in d pretext that 'they are d future of our country'. Else we'll get more JNU like scenarios in future..& our society is going to be a mess! Also i urge students to stay away from politics till u graduate. Study hard n enjoy ur college life.
