But, I couldn't. My legs that you thought were Swift as those of a deer, They froze. Maai, they froze.  But I sent the horses home.  Maai, them monsters, They had no horns or fangs, Or deadly long nails. But they hurt me. They hurt me bad, Maai. The purple flowers, The yellow butterflies, They stood there helpless.  While I sent the horses back home.  Maai, Tell Baba that I know, I know, I know he tried. I heard him say out my name, I heard him repeat it loud. But, I was sleepy Maai, I was tired. Them monsters, They hurt me bad.  Strange as it may seem to you, Maai, It feels like your warmth now. It doesn't hurt anymore. The blood has dried And it looks like the purple blossoms That swayed with me in the meadows. It doesn't hurt, Maai.  Maai, The monsters are still out there. And there are stories too. Don't listen to them Maai, Gut wrenching and agonizing they are And a lot you've gone through.  Maai, Lest I forget, There's a temple there Where lives a goddess. Thank her, For I think it's she who helped,  The horses find their way back home.  #JusticeForKhatuaVictim", "gauravchauhans": "#JusticeForAsifa", "quotes.0325": "U shit ppl, an innocent as suffer so much n u r playing religion game, whoevr hav said tht kareena married a muslim n named him taimur, toh tera kya ja raha hai re, shaadi ke liye terese paise liye the kya, get a life dude, we are humans 1st.
