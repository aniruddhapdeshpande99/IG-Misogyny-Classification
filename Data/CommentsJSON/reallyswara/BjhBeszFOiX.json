Its actually quite ironic considering you express yourself as such a humane person. Now let's educate you, shall we? Pakistan for starters is not under shariah law. Secondly, it is not a failing nation. It is a nation that is fighting terrorism and the wrath of extremist radicals. I think as an indian you would know what that's like. Lastly, Padmaavat got a lot of opposition in India to the point that it almost got banned and people wanted Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Deepika Padukone's heads.
