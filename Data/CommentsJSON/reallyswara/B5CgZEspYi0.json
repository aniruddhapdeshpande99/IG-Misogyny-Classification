A taxpayer is paying money for every goddamn thing the Government does. Nobody will be affected. Yes there are genuine students who actually can not afford the hiked fee but it doesn\u2019t have to come out like this! A graduation student who stays in JNU hostel can easily earn a minimum of &5000 by providing tuitions only. I have also done that. This completely shows the lack of boost and confidence the students have upon themselves. Simultaneously, these protestors are affecting the sentiments of other students who are having to miss their classes because of them. Students of other centrally funded universities are outraging upon such gesture of the JNU students, look around you, look on the internet, go through honest Quora answers and see how these protests are actually affecting the way people look at JNU. \u201cEducation doesn\u2019t have a price, it has a value\u201d said some of the banners held during the protests, and I so disagree to that. Everything in this word comes for a price. And youngster like me can not always be in their Comfort zones. Put 2 hours a day into something, home tuition or something else, I bet, nobody will be taking less than \u20b96000 per month with that.
