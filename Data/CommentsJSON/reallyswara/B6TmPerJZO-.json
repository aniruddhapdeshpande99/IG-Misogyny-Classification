So what i came across was really horrifying not only for the protesters but also for the police force too. The way you showed the police force thrashing a mob , do you even know why they did that. The so called peaceful protest at daryaganj turned violent and protesters literally set a private car ablaze obviously the police had to take action. Ik that some people are gonna say that criminals usually take advantage of such situation and wreak havoc in the society and yeah it turned out to be true in most of the violent incidents occurring majority of people involved in them were not normal protesters or college students infact many had criminal backgrounds and this fact was confirmed by the police force themselves. but then If you're going to protest peacefully then it's your responsibility to ensure that no kind of violence occurs at such a protest because even if a single person causes any sort of vandalism or violence then the entire group will be responsible for that infact i would say it's our responsibility to ensure that nothing like this occurs so the government won't have an excuse to detain the entire group of protesters for investigation.This video basically tells us just one side of the story, at this protest which turned violent after police had to intervene, 36 people were injured out of which 8 were police officers and had to be taken to Lok Nayak Hospital. obviously police denied the lathi charging which is clearly visible in this video that's what i feel was wrong on their side and what you did was equally wrong. I myself am against this act but rather than just following the crowd like sheeps i researched on this act and read a lot of articles which told me that how it was discriminatory and how it was going to affect a certain community in a negative way but 80-90% of these protesters don't even know what's the full form of CAA infact in a recent protest when Farhan Akhtar was asked in what way is this act discriminatory and he was literally dumbfounded.
