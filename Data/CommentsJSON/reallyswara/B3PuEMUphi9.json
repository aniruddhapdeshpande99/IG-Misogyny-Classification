To begin with , Line 3 of the Mumbai Metro is a 33.5 km long underground metro connecting Colaba and SEEPZ, with 26 underground and 1 at grade station. This line is possibly the most critical line of the Mumbai Metro as it connects 6 prominent business districts (Cuffe-Parade ,Nariman Point,Ballard Estate,Lower Parel area ,BKC ,SEEPZ), 2 outstation terminuses (CSMT, Mumbai Central) and 2 terminals of Airport. Now once again NGO mafia are confusing people by saying that \u201cgreen lungs of Mumbai will be destroyed\u201d. Firstly , many are confused between Sanjay Gandhi National Park and Aarey. Sanjay Gandhi National Park is spread over 11,687 hectares. Aarey Colony is SEPARATE from it and is 1287 hectares. The metro shed will be built only on 30 hectares of Aarey Land and even in those 30 hectares , 5 hectares would be kept absolutely intact and 25 be used for crashed. Thus , only 2 percent of the entire Aarey Colony would be used for the metro shed. Also , 83% of this carshed area is already without tree cover. Also , this carshed location is surrounded by 3 major roads - JVLR, Marol-Maroshi Road and Goregaon Powai road. Now talking in terms of trees ,as per 2017-2018 tree census , Mumbai has approximately 29.75 lakh trees and in Aarey Milk Colony has approximately 4.8 lakh trees, the metro carshed area has 3691 trees , out of which 461 trees will be transplanted and 2,185 trees cut while the rest wont be touched. But to compensate for the 2,185 cut trees , 6 times more new trees are to be planted and also geotagged. Not many activists would tell these facts. Nowhere is the claim by NGO mafia led activists - that Mumbai\u2019s green lungs are being destroyed , is close to reality. And Aarey is not a forest as claimed by activists. It is a dairy and grazing land. National Green Tribunal and Bombay High Court have rejected the activists claim of Aarey being forest. That\u2019s why the name -Aarey \u2018Milk\u2019 Colony.
