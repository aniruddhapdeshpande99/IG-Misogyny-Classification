I'm just watching since few days how these media houses, politicians, bollywood and some of my friends are emphasizing \"Asifa\" rather than \"Justice\". Reasons are obvious, it's only the name that has the masala which the media and politicians can use for their benefit. Neither have they really ever cared about them, nor will they care today. Otherwise till date I had never seen that the \"Real\" name of any rape victim is made public. Even the 2012 Delhi rape victim was (and is) called Nirbhaya, which was not her real name. Till yesterday, people (I'm not mentioning you individually, you yourself know) who used to say criminal is a criminal, he has no religion, the same people are writing lines like \"Few Hindus raped and killed a Muslim girl\". Seriously? One incident, and u lost all ur conscience? Why don't we focus on \"Justice\" rather than determining her religion. After all this is what we have always taught one another. So why not today? Why Hindu or Muslim? Remember, politicians or media will just look out for making a profit out of the incident. But people like you and me, we are just concerned about one thing, and that is \"Justice\", justice for that little angel, that little soul! Hinduism or Islam have nothing to do with it. And yes, regardless to mention, the culprits should be punished, punished so hard that no other dog dare to even think of touching the daughters or sisters on the roads out there. \"Justice\" for Asifa!", "chinmay__deshmukh": "@reallyswara , No wondered you are anti Hindu.", "lokendra_0000": "Pehle swara ne rani padmavati k liye kaha ki johar se acha rape h or aaj aasifa k liye apne hindu hone par shram h plz tell me who are you?", "suryakumawat": "Totally chutiyapa......bc publicity chahiye thi to bhikh mang leti.....q khud ka chutiya katwa rhi h.....pardon my language but h katai chutiya soch", "amitfit21": "Go n watch zee news they exposed people like u...
