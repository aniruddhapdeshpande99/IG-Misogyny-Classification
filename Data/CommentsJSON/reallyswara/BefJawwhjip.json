What would have happened if she didn't involve in the act of jauhar? She would have been enslaved by Khilji and sexually assaulted till her last breath AGAINST her will. Sati practice involved the wife of the deceased being pushed to pyre forcefully as the society didn't except widows even if she had the will to live an independent life. Is it that Padmavati didn't try to tackle Khilji? No. But you were 'reduced to a vagina' after watching the movie. And then I come across you being a part of a film like #veerediwedding where they want to show that if the boys can swear and commitment phobic, girls can do the same. They can hit a man's butt. That they are #notachickflick. Why are you even normalising such acts? Is this how you define #genderequality? By doing the same trash things even if it is not morally right?

The khilji ruler was a characterless animal,and yet used arabic words as if Allah support such muslims. Who will justify that?The queen padmavati is seeking permission of self immolation from her husband and mentioning she cant even die without his permission. Who is he?Her God?.. Who will justify that?.. So.. My point is.. This movie should be watched with keeping 13th century in mind and like a purely fictional poetry written by that writer. Poets always exaggerate to make things looks dramatic. While cinema always add the extra masala so that it can feed the eyes of viewers and not the vision. However..

What people don't understand is, you are not asking that historical facts should have been changed but that there should have been some condemnation of the act of self immolation. The kind of creative freedom an artist has, they could use it their advantage to address social challenges our society faces today. Since time immemorial the \"izzat\" of a family, kingdom, clan has been placed inside a woman's vagina, without her consent. Women today don't want this burden. It is a burden to be shared equally by every member of the society, man or woman. So yes, I would also choose a chance at life or die fighting than immolate myself coz I carry this burden that patriarchy dumped on me.

You in your letter have made absolute strong points but the comparison u made with gang rape incident and Johar is irrelevant and they are definitely not the different sides of the same coin. Johar is a choice and decision but rape definitely isn't a choice. U put across some bold points which described how disturbing it was to see a pregnant women jump into that pit. You also said u would opt to live instead of jumping into the fire even at the cost of being a slave to a monster like Khilji. Well Mam that's your decision to live your life and I totally respect that, but why do u have a problem with Queen Padmini's decision. As I said it's individual preference. You very smartly compiled the whole topic to matter of mere Vaginal protection, but there is much more to it, it's about dignity and self respect that the women chose. Your letter is beautiful, exquisitely written yet flawed. The problem is you are imposing your thoughts. Sati is when u forcefully push a women to die when her spouse is dead and that is absolutely regressive, but in the context of this particular movie Johar was performed for self respect and dignity. U are trying to trick people by engaging and connecting this topic with Henious crimes like gang rape and murder. The situation and circumstances are totally different.
