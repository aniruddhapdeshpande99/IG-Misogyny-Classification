Or were you in deemed college? OBC/SC students gets subsidised fee, ST students have to pay zero tuition fees and hostel fees. I\u2019m still confused are you really a doctor? Out of 150 batch 15-20 students fail in first year MBBS and most of them are from reserved categories (ps I\u2019ve no objection with category students receiving free education). Well let\u2019s not talk about MBBS there are other fields too where students fail. Failure should never be the issue. You have been brainwashed by zee news. They have compared Kanhaiya Kumars age with every JNU student. Ma\u2019am education takes time, PhD takes time. If you are a surgeon and you have completed your PG in US you must have spend at least 8 years in completing your course. And if you are talking about completing residency in India then yes, we have to pay. And I\u2019m sure you might have gotten the seat through NRI quota! No wonder you\u2019re complaining! Who has set such rules that only after completing your education you can join politics? Is there any? If you\u2019ve never seen complaining a med kid about his fees, were you really a med kid? We complain a lot! You are correct but only in one thing i.e why only JNU should get free education. Yes we all should get, we all must protest for free education, it\u2019s our birth right and not just JNU student! Did I mention med school or residency? Well I don\u2019t know about you but my cousin is in UK doing her PG and she\u2019s paid around 2700 pounds \ud83d\ude0a", "iam_aaravrajput": "Swara Tuu Konsi Garib hai JNU ki fee efford nahi kar skti tji", "rajeev.music": "\u092f\u0939\u093e \u0924\u094b \u0935\u093f\u0937\u0948\u0932\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u092e\u092a\u0902\u0925 \u0915\u0940 \u092c\u0926\u092c\u0942 \u0906 \u0930\u0939\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "shivamtiwari_76": "To madam bacho ko kaho padhe Roz Roz dhrne pe baith Kate h kejriwal ki trh", "the_10th_man": "Yeah really wanna ask the amazing scholars of JNU to give me one example where Socialism has actually worked lol", "bgm__nation": "#standwithjnu", "kahani_khor_kkay": "I really like ths girl.. being so busiest.. she is socially very much aware and active for social causes...
