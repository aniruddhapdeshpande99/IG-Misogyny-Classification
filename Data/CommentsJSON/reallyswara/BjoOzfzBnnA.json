My observation is that you were talking about how they treat the women living there etc. This is one thing that I think makes a country great and how they treat the women. Compared to India I can say that their fashion industry is more inclusive to the women they service then the Indian fashion industry. A lot of the top Pakistani designers and many stores make clothes for people who are \"PLUS SIZE\" at a very affordable price. Meanwhile the Indian fashion industry and many premium designers are charging upwards $500+ for sizes that only service people who have a chest size of 40 inches and have a trust fund because lets be real how can a ordinary personal with regular income afford a designer clothing such as @sabyasachiofficial @manishmalhotra05 plus many other brands .
