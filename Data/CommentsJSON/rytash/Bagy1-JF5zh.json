Just one thing mam. As u have written \"of course he's my dada he cares about planet\". Plz don't connect traditions and customs with environment pollution. It hurt people's religious sentiments. Although even i want my all organs to be donated once I'm dead but its not becaude I think Hindu traditions are some bad or something like that. Its about choice. And traditions are something, specially in Hinduism, which have scientific reasonings. Plus you can't blame rituals and traditions for being environment unfriendly even when we are using phones, AC, Fridge, 2 wheelers, Cars, ATM, etc which harms the environment. Or we are supportibg industries which are harming the environemnt. I don't mean any offense to you ot anyone here but just thought I should atleast speak up. And yes, i felt truly inspired by uncle.
