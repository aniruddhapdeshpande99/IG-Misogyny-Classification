{"tea_bea": "I\u2019m sure this will make for less sexy television than whatever we\u2019re going to see on this show, but for me and most of the people I know, the way we handle it is not much different from how anyone handles having multiple things going on in their lives. If you have one partner, a job, a class you take, friends, and a volunteering obligation, you divide up your time between those priorities. It\u2019s the same when you have more than one partner. There might be more feelings involved when your priorities include more than one romantic or sexual partner, but let\u2019s also not pretend that monogamous couples don\u2019t struggle with issues of jealousy or feeling imbalanced between their relationship and their jobs/friends/hobbies. A lot do. That\u2019s an issue for a lot of people\u2014it\u2019s not just about sex with other people. A lot of the time/for a lot of people, polyamory is not some sort of nonstop group hottubbing and communal living thing. It\u2019s really just like anyone who does more than one thing with their time. I don\u2019t even like doing that many things! It can be as boring as you\u2019d like it to be! The way I usually describe my polyamory is honestly \u201cI watch Netflix on more than one couch on a regular basis.\u201d \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "zafarwestern": "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc4f", "ganlysarah": "@chuckchicken", "thomas_courtney": "This looks like a fun display of backwards values and sad people.", "kittysixbysix": "Never again", "hempzelia": "Hey hey this is awesome \ud83d\udc97I poly wassup peeps\ud83d\ude0a", "saint_james_23": "The first time I watched your show I thought it would be kind of weird.
