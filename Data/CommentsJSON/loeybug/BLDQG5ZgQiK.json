I want to tell you it gets easier, but it doesn't - you will burst into tears over the silliest things and you will always be waiting for a call that won't come. I know you just had your first Christmas without him and I am so sorry you had to experience that pain. The way I get through is by still talking to him, still wishing him goodnight and striving to be the daughter I know he would be proud to have .... And let me tell you, your papa can be darn proud of you.. You inspire, save and often give thousands of women the self love they need to keep going.
