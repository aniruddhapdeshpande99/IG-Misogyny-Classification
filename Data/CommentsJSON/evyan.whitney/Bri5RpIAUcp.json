We must remember that this fear is what drives oppression and the only way to reduce fear is to focus on education and providing an outlet. Unfortunately the aforementioned companies are solicitors of fear as we witnessed during the last presidential election. The only way to battle this is to be truthful to ourselves and to understand that oppression is the only tool that they have against us speaking the truth and by speaking it we lessen their power.
