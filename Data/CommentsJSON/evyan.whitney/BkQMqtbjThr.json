I really needed the encouragement and to know I'm not alone and to see brave queer black femmes like you.

I have struggled a lot with feeling like I need to prove that I'm not a prude or whatever other stereotypes and misconceptions people have about demi people.

Like, how does your man actually react after you\u2019ve just had sex with someone else? I\u2019d love to hear more about how a non-monogamous dynamic works when a bi woman is exercising that freedom with all genders. Also are there ever racial politics invoked?
