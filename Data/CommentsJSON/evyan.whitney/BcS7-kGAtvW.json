In Poland people tend to use diminutive versions of names, in this case mine was Kasia. It's a very sweet name and it was ok when I was called like that by my friends and family or when I was a young girl, but as I was getting older, I was not comfortable with this version. It felt like it's inappropriate for a stranger to call me that, since it felt too personal or too \"sweet\". I tried to figure out a different name for myself, but nothing really sticked, I guess polish people are very conservative about names... Whenever I was introducing myself as Katarzyna, people would assume straight away they could call me Kasia. It's in the culture I guess, but it was irritating, especially when I was way into my 20s. Then I moved abroad, and here nobody called me anything other then my real name. I started using \"Katarzyna\" or, to make it shorter, Kat. I love both of these versions and I use both of them. They feel really true to me :) Now, when somebody calls me Kasia, even within my family, it feels very strange, I don't identify with this name anymore.
