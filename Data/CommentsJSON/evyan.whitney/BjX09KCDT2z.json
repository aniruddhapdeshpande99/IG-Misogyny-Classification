I came across this and you look beautiful. I totally hear your comment but my question is where do you draw the line? My daughter is 12, has been on Instagram for a year and has access to the full plethora of what\u2019s on insta feeds. Also my account got hacked by a porn site which I have to say the images were horrendous. So where does the line get drawn? How do young teenage girls differentiate, understand, accept the beautiful-ness of our bodies when it\u2019s depicted in so many ways? Like I said I have literally come across you and I\u2019ll listen to Julies\u2019s podcast. But I am interested in what you feel about this and how mothers/parents navigate devices, insta feeds that sometimes do have pornographic content in them, and hashtags that don\u2019t always reflect the empress side of a woman\u2019s body that young children who have devices can type in to see it all. \u2764\ufe0f", "wildandvibrant": "And also thank you for showing up and saying that all sexuality work is on a spectrum of sex work. The sexological Bodyworker, the dancer, the escort, the pole dance class, the priestess schools, the sex therapists and new sex Ed, the sexual healer, the sex magic witch, the writers, the sluts, yoni eggs, crystal Healing, the cam workers, the woman out there knowing her gift is in sexuality, however it shows up. The idea that this is a spectrum is potent and recognized and I hear you exclaim the truth in this way. That you don\u2019t get to teach pole class and not show up politically to support sex workers. That this divide is built on racism and classism and heteronormative capitalist ideals. I also hear you saying once again it\u2019s okay and good to love the fuck out of your body and yourself.
