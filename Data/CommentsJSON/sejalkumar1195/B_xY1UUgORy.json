If she thinks that it's not her business. Then i want you guys to answer me why even you are following her(i am not a follower anymore) why she don't care when females do such things. She is an influencer aur iske crowd ko wahi dikhega to boys locker room pr hua, false allegation mein mar gaya vo ladka uska hisab kaun krega. Kab tak wait krogey jab tak tumhare ghar mein nahi hoga aisa? Stop following wuch hypocrite influencers. Give me an answer why there is no outrage now. By no mean i am supporting locker room act. Not even against anything. But hum ladko ki zindagi ki koi value nahi hai kya? We all aee rapist? Hum ghatia he soch leke paida hotey hai? Hum isi layak hain kya? Jawab do.
