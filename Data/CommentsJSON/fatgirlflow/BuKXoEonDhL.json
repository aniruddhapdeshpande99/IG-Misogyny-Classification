I\u2019ve been trying to stop dressing for what\u2019s flattering and just wear what I like myself, I think my sticking point is body con dresses though - I haven\u2019t done that yet x", "rmhbernoff": "I used to be terrified to tuck my shirts in, but I fully dgaf now and life is so much better!", "comfyfattravels": "I would certainly tuck in my shirts more if i wasnt so weird about my vbo!", "matthew.winston": "Sexy \ud83c\udf39", "chriscrawford71592": "I've grown a belly over the past few years so I know that one of my issues is the internalized shame that comes with that but also the shame of most of my clothes not fitting right...I need new clothes is what I'm trying to say lol.", "lil.ranch.life": "For VBO I would wear more crop tops.

I seriously struggle with my VBO. Why? Cause I've been conditioned to, yes. But also like you said, when I was younger in particular, it was like if I could cover that one thing, I could pretend that I wasn't (and that everyone around wouldn't think I was) fat.

I always wore baggy clothes to cover it until now. I mean, I'm still insecure sometimes, but for the most part I'm just like, \"no one gets to choose what I wear for me. I'll wear whatever I want, regardless.\" One thing I wanna try is form fitting dresses. One of my biggest fears. (Also, side note. My mom and I love your posts and your realness. Thank you for being you. \u2665\ufe0f)"}
