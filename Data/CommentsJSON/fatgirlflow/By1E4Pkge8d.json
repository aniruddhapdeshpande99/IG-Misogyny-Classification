It's beautiful.", "madison.lizann": "I don't get the focus on \"don't be fat!\" People should focus on \"take care of your body!\" This separates health and self care from size. When I was younger I thought being healthy was about staying thin and keeping your body in a desirable state. I had no idea that I should take care of myself because that's what my body needed and it would make me feel happier. Now when I do something like exercise or eat a healthy food I think about it'll make me feel good and how my body needs it. When I do something \"unhealthy\" like eat a sugary snack or have a lazy day I remind myself that I don't need to beat myself up over it.
