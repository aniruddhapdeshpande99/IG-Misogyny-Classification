A thin woman, taking about how she is struggling with the negative views on her real or perceived flaws, and working towards body positivity is applauded. A fat woman finally achieves her goal of being on the cover of a magazine is attacked and labeled as glorifying obesity. Why? Because there can not be anything loveable about fat women, according to our society. I also don't believe in the reclaiming of words, regardless of what derogatory term it is. Reusing the word, is one individual saying they accept the word and that the word can no longer hurt them. But it continues to be damaging to millions of other individuals who haven't found such acceptance. It also fails to prove a point to those who use it negatively, because their brain will never comprehend that the words are used in anything but a negative manner. Furthermore, by trying to reclaim, glorifying obesity, you (general you) keep that term circulating in the vocabulary of society. And it spreads from one person, town, generation to the next. Continuing the cycle of this hurtful and hateful term. I'd rather people say,. The negative use of glorifying obesity, can no longer hurt me because I have come to love and find glory in who I am.
