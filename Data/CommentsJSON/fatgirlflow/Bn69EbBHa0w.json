I am tired of decades of trying to fit myself into a perfect package. I don't know what that means. Hopefully it means I will just stop admiring and loving all of you in the fat acceptance community from afar and join you.", "ginnyatchison": "\u2764You ARE brave and the respect you demand is absolutely valid in my humble opinion \ud83d\udc93 As I know, being fat is exhausting, all-consuming. But one thing I've come to realise, mainly amongst the online community of other fatties, such as myself, is that we are probably the least demanding humans out there. WHY?..because all we ever wanted was to 'blend in'. To go about our business without feeling somehow, that we are different. We didn't ask to be challenged, we don't ask to be treated any differently, but we are. Society got out of hand, it collectively intimidated us. Our eating disorders and other complex mental 'unwellness' was and is a reflection of how we are often screaming inside because we detest ourselves on the outside. But, little by little, because of strong humans such as you and many others in our community, we are breaking down the barriers and allowing self-love and a confidence we never thought we had, to shout out to the world that it doesn't f***ing matter what size we are, we are ALL beautiful. We are ALL fabulous and we ALL want to just live a happy life, free from judgement and stigma. It really is that simple! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc6d\ud83d\udc6c\ud83d\udc6b\u2764\ud83d\udc97\u2764\ud83d\udc97", "rquigl03": "You\u2019re my spirit animal.
