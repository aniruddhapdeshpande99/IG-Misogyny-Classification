Skinny, fat, tall, poor, wealthy and yep, even healthy. High blood pressure does as well. Can changing your diet give you different results? Sometimes. Because you changed the situation, you won't get the same result. ALLLLL of that said, the BMI chart was made in the 50's. Before the government and Big Corp ever put hormones and chemicals in the food we eat to mass produce it. So using outdated measurement systems to \"measure a person's health\" is idiotic. Doctors? Are educated guessers. Sure, they go to school and learn more than the average Joe but at the end of the day, they're guessing. Last but certainly not least we're ALL going to die. Every one of us. No one lives forever. We could be athletic runners who drop dead at 32 from a heart attack. We could be 18 year old students who get a blood clot and die.
