Im not saying you do this, but, there is something to be said for promoting the idea that you can be healthy when morbidly obese. I believe in loving yourself at any size, and I know that getting to a \u201chealthy weight\u201d or BMI can be extremely difficult. Lately I\u2019ve struggled with plus size women promoting the idea that being super obese is OK, purely from a medical and statistical standpoint, because there are a lot of serious health issues that can arise, including death, from this.
