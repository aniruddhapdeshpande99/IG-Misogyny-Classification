The weight limit is 275, and I am currently 270 and 5 ft 5in...at first I could not even swing my leg over to just get on it w/o falling over and crashing. After moving the seat down as far as it would go, straddling it, and very slowly and carefully putting one foot on the peddle, and pushing off (of course after many more painful crashes) I can now ride it and get some decent exercise. But I'm very shakey and nervous because i cannot just stop abruptly w/o crashing. To stop, I have to start a block ahead of my intended stopping point, take my feet off the peddles, and coast while balancing all 270 lbs of me until the bike stops on it's own lol. It's not until then that I can actually squeeze the brakes, and slowly and carefully swing my hamhock of a thigh over the seat to \"dismount\" and get off my bike....... and after 6 months of this I still fall half the time lol. I go through all of this crap because for the few minutes that I'm upright, cruising down the street, music blaring, wind in my hair, it's almost magical. And I love it! **Moral of the story** is if I could afford a kickass tricycle like that, or if more fat people friendly bicycles were made, and were AFFORDABLE I wouldn't have to kill myself every time I went through the process of riding my not-so-fat-girl-friendly but affordable bicycle.", "appleoferis": "I want a tricycle and that outfit!!!", "kaylajayloo": "Cutest ever!!!", "comfortforward": "FUCK YEAH look at you go!
