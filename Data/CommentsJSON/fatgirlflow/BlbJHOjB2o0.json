I\u2019m in the military and work hard for my money but definitely don\u2019t get paid comparable to how much I should be considering the hours and risk factors. I also have $40K+ in school loans I\u2019m slowly but surely paying off. Which is why I\u2019m more conscious of where I\u2019m willing to splurge more and clothes are usually it since I like to dress in comfortable, nicely made clothes whenever I\u2019m not forced to wear my uniform all the time. Notice I refer to quality several times. $28 is cheaper if it\u2019s a higher quality item no matter your size. If it was cheaply made then I\u2019d agree it was expensive for something of poor quality. You get what you pay for, stores would lose money if they charged the same amount for something made of a higher quality material compared to a lower (and the work put into making it matters to).
