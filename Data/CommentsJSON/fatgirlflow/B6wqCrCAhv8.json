But ya know.. eat some lean meats, fruits and veggies.. and god forbid. When you're thirsty.. drink W A T E R .. no one can tell me that's \"unhealthy for you\" . Go for a walk on nice afternoons, itll make ya feel good. Boost any depression and ya know.. light cardio is always good for you :) no hate.
