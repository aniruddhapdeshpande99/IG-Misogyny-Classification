With obvious awareness and eye contact of/with you both) when they saw you? Orrr were they having a conversation that was demonstrably in full swing with or without yourself and J being the catalyst? It sounds pedantic I know, but the reason I ask is - if the former, you should definitely say something if in a similar situation again and should certainly have been entitled to move - in that scenario they\u2019re basically singling out and bullying you whilst you\u2019re trying to enjoy your breakfast, which is completely unacceptable. If the latter, however... whilst showing themselves to be fantastically nasty unpleasant people, they\u2019re as entitled to discuss their \u201cfriends\u201d (who needs mates like that seriously?!) as you guys are to talk about whatever you\u2019d like at your table. You could say that it\u2019s akin to overhearing foul comments that should be shut down whether they\u2019re specific to you or not - racism, misogyny, homophobia etc - but then you get into a whole separate thing of whether size joins those things as being utterly non-negotiable or alterable, OR, also, if we\u2019re allowed to police other people\u2019s conversations when they\u2019re among adults and aren\u2019t actively trying to victimise anyone in their immediate surroundings (no matter how truly horrible they are as individuals - they\u2019ve paid to sit and chat just as you have). It\u2019s a genuinely sticky one with valid if tediously well-trodden moral/ethical/logistical arguments on both sides depending on the specific situation. None of which negate however - let\u2019s be clear - that yourself and J felt shitty and that\u2019s crap to hear.
