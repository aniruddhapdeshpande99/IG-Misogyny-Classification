Sadly, it feels like nowadays slim women who are naturally slim (and get called STICKS or worse (which is considered bullying)) are made to feel like shit. And women who choose to have breast implants are also massively judged. There\u2019s no need. Women should have the right to be and do what they want - no judgment. If someone doesn\u2019t like their heavy body or their slim body and wants to change that that\u2019s their right and to be done with no judgement. Of course social media has a weird pressure that women can feel coz so many women still pose very unnatural like you\u2019re displaying and bringing awareness to in this post which I massively support. Also let\u2019s be honest. It\u2019s other women who are mean to other women. This is the largest problem in society and why women have such a long way to go when it comes to women\u2019s rights. Women don\u2019t even support women so how can we expect anyone else to?"}
