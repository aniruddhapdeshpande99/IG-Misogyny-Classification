This isn\u2019t a \u201cshe/he is asking for it\u201d suggestion, but more that if society is perfectly fine with sexualising pretty much every part of life, from adverts, TV, music videos, films, social media - how can it not be held somewhat accountable for the repercussions? Example - I\u2019m sure Justin Bieber and a like get thousands of unsolicited fanny pics, which is JUST as morally corrupt as girls receiving dick shots, but then as a sex symbol and someone who hyper sexualises himself and that becomes his brand, does he have a part to play in offering an alternative view of himself? sexuality is of course something to cherish and support, but should the question be more - is there now a space in media that ISNT sexualised?
