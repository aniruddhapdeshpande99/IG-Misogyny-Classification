My name is Ronny and I\u2018m Luke\u2019s Dad. Luke suffers from a rare peculiarity with the name \u201cProgeria\u201d, which means that his body is aging 10 times faster than (y)ours. Therefore, our time together is very limited. In order to make Luke\u2019s short life as beautiful as possible, I quit my job. Unfortunately, I don't get any financial support from the German state. Neither in his treatment nor in the financing of flights to the United States where we are under treatment. In Germany only two cases of progeria are known, so there is no research or treatment here. This year we have to travel to America as a family to pick up medicines that have been proven to extend Luke's life a little longer! Before that we have to stay in the Boston Children\u2019s hospital and Luke has to undergo a fortnight of medical procedures. We have to make this trip every two years and that's why I'm trying to fund it through social media channels with advertising revenue. We hope that with gaining more followers we might be able to draw attention to advertisers, who could help paying the bills. We are not begging for money, only attention! Additionally, my wife and I hope that Luke\u2019s life will be a little bit easier in the future thanks to his popularity. If people know him and meet him on the streets, they might hopefully not tease him or say that he looks strange. We would rather hear them say things like \u201cOh, there\u2019s Luke. I know him from Facebook/Instagram\u201d instead of hearing mean and hurtful comments. Luke\u2019s future won\u2019t be an easy one because he will look different than what we would describe as \u201cThe Norm\u201d. However, we hope deeply that most of the reactions will be positive and not hurtful. Would you join us on our journey and mention Luke to your follower #weallsupportluke ?
