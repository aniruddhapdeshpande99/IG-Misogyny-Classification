I was extremely emotional throughout the entire movie and I found myself crying before the characters started crying. I see myself in \u201cMae\u201d and \u201cChristine,\u201d and I believe the pathology of Black mothers having a hard time showing love and affection to their daughters really put my own relationship with my mother in perspective. I know many other Black women can relate to feeling unloved by their mothers because their is a lack of affection and our ptsd (post traumatic slave disorder) that was created from our enslavement in this country. Then the relationship that \u201cChristine\u201d had with \u201cIssac\u201d made me realize that I might be missing out on a chance to find love with a Black man that I have been friends with for almost 20 years because of my fear of losing him and losing our friendship. Thank you for making this beautiful art piece of BLACK \ud83d\udc95 LOVE. This is definitely 1 of my favorite movies of all times. Thank u Issa for choosing to show Black women as our authentic beautiful selves. Also, thank u to the entire cast & crew for creating & being Black excellence.
