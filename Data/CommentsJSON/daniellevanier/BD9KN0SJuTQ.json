There's so much going on in there If you think about it. Nearly all of our vital organs are squished into that small space and then surgery exposes them to the world...it just leaves room for many and more issues to arise while fixing an original issue. It's very unfortunate that while fixing one potentially fatal diagnosis another serious illness arises due to surgical complications. No surgery is without risk and as long as you trust your doctors, their staff, and the hospital you will be fine.
