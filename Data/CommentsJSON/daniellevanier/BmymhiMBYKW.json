Anyway, I always have an issue getting clothes to fit over my large hips and for that reason I never EVER wear trousers. Always in a skirt or dress. Don\u2019t even own a pair of jeans... can you believe that!? I always feel over dressed for occasions because I always wear a dress so would love to learn the right style and shape of trousers to fit me. Can go casual or smart then!

I\u2019ve been shopping and tried in so many jumpsuits, in so many different styles and I just can\u2019t find any that I feel comfortable in.
