I am a Christian and I have already forgiven her. I hate that our family is split apart. My home was ruined, my life, my love, my career, my lively hood. What I mean by that is I haven\u2019t been able to work as an engineer since then because of my emotional depression. I got to know about Dr Obudu watching YouTube someone testify about how he saved his marriage from divorce so I said let me give it a try and today I have my wife back after 3 days.
