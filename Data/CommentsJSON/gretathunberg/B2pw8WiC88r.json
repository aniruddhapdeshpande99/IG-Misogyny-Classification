You are the biggest consumers of manufactured goods by far and update perfectly good expensive luxury items to stay trendy. Your entertainment comes from electric devices. Furthermore, the people driving your protests are the same people who insist on artificially inflating the population growth through immigration, which increases the need for energy, manufacturing and transport. The more people we have, the more forest and bush land we clear and more of the environment is destroyed. How about doing this instead: Tell your teachers to switch off the air-conditioning. Walk or ride to school. Switch off your devices and read a book. Make a sandwich instead of buying manufactured fast food. Sadly, none of this will happen because many of you are indoctrinated by those you trust, along with being taught virtue signaling principles. You are inspired by the adults around you who crave a feeling of having a \u2018noble cause\u2019 while they indulge themselves in Western luxury and an unprecedented quality of life.

You want TV in every room and your classes are all computerised. You spend all day and night on electronic devices. More than ever, you don't walk or ride bikes to school but arrive in caravans of private cars that choke local roads and worsen rush hour traffic. You are the biggest consumers of manufactured goods ever and update perfectly good expensive luxury items to stay trendy, Your entertainment comes from electric devices. Furthermore, the people driving your protests are the same people who insist on artificially inflating the population growth through immigration, which increases the need for energy, manufacturing and transport. The more people we have, the more forest and bushland we clear and more of the environment is destroyed. How about this... Tell your teachers to switch off the air-con. Walk or ride to school. Switch off your devices and read a book. Make a sandwich instead of buying manufactured fast food. No, none of this will happen because you are selfish, badly educated, virtue signalling little 'princesses', inspired by the adults around you who crave a feeling of having a 'noble cause' while they indulge themselves in Western luxury and unprecedented quality of life. Wake up, grow up and learn to research facts and think for yourself and not blindly accept the words and thoughts of others - I don't think you formulated this action plan all by your self - suspect you may have had some influence and 'guidance' from those you trust ....a word of warning, be cautious of the influence of the 'left' because there may be a time in the future that you will be the ones left out...", "camilla.june": "You go girl!\ud83e\udd29", "gosun": "Over 500 were striking in Mendocino ,Ca with a population of 894", "st_roche": "\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a", "jamiesmoz": "Thank you so much!

In a second moment, it is urgent to invest heavily in the PREVENTION of these events, as, for example, in the fight against claims at the moment when they still present themselves as easily extinct FOCUS.

Thousands of birds, natural DRONES, with implanted nano-chips and various embedded items such as: high resolution camera, heat / temperature sensor, anemometer, GPS, accelerometer, altimeter, solar battery / movement, etc. 24h monitoring of fire and burn outbreaks, however small, connected to the sophisticated monitoring and command center. It should be integrated into the satellite surveillance system. Innovative resource rationalization project, fireNOfire Solutions will be the solution to forestry claims prevention by eliminating outbreaks with minimal water consumption and financial, material and human resources.
