Your fight is just beginning and I pray that you succeed. 10 years for change is too long. Example: Colorado is making it mandatory in 5 years that some 5% of cars on dealer lots have to be electric. I believe we are in need of 75% not 5% and not in 5 years more like in the next year. We are moving FAR TO SLOWLY and a little patch here and a little patch there may solidify happiness to many, because the DO NOT UNDERSTAND, the Severity of our planets actual condition. I think all countries and states also need to make any car older than 15 years illegal. I get that is difficult as many people cannot afford \u201cnewer\u201d than 15 year old cars.
