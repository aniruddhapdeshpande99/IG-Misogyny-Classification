Globally, we experience the worst planetary pandemic following Covid-19.

Together with a group of citizens and artists who love Culture and Art, it has occurred to us to implement an international \"online\" campaign, symbolically, once the \"World Pandemic\" ends, that the citizens of each country, let us go out to the forests, national parks, squares and streets to embrace the trees as \"love\" towards the planet and life: they represent the new paradigm of \"caring for the ecosystem of all\".
