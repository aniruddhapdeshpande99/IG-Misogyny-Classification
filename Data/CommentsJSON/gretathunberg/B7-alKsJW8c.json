I think that the production cost in the industry will be the energy cost excluding the labor cost. . Raw material costs will be zero. With almost no cost, rare metals can be recycled indefinitely. The price of the product is set to labor costs. The professional ethics of ascetic Protestantism interpret that engaging in professional work is God's command on humans. Companies are obliged to hire and engage in labor and pay wages. However, there is no need to pursue profits. Anime Thunderbird's International Rescue is professional work?
