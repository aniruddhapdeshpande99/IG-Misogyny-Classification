However, human beings cannot implement a black hole engine to combat global warming. However, for the project of human migration to Universe, a black hole engine can be implemented. I thought so.  Global warming will be solved if mankind obtains a powerful energy source with almost zero cost. If the project of human migration to the universe is seriously set, the innovation will be realized. For example, black hole engines are set by technologists as a real challenge.  So, if a black hole engine is realized, wouldn't the production cost in the industry be zero? I think that the production cost in the industry will be the energy cost excluding the labor cost. . Raw material costs will be zero. With almost no cost, rare metals can be recycled indefinitely. The price of the product is set to labor costs. The professional ethics of ascetic Protestantism interpret that engaging in professional work is God's command on humans. Companies are obliged to hire and engage in labor and pay wages. However, there is no need to pursue profits. Anime Thunderbird's International Rescue is professional work? International Rescue does not pursue profit.  Isn't this a second industrial revolution? Humanity will be freed from the constraints of profit hunting and will be able to engage in various projects as professional labor  Thank you", "jorge_luis0799": "No falten a clase.. no tiene ning\u00fan resultado sino dejar da aprender..
