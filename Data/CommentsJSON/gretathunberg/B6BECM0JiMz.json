Dos clasificaciones de micropl\u00e1sticos existen actualmente: micropl\u00e1sticos primarios, los cuales son fabricados espec\u00edficamente para ser utilizados en productos; y micropl\u00e1sticos secundarios, los cuales derivan del proceso de deterioro de desechos pl\u00e1sticos m\u00e1s grandes, como las partes de pl\u00e1stico macrosc\u00f3picas que conforman la Isla de basura del Pac\u00edfico.[3] Se ha demostrado que los dos tipos de micropl\u00e1sticos permanecen en el medioambiente en altas concentraciones, particularmente en ecosistemas marinos y lacustres. Debido a que no se biodegrada y solo se desintegra en partes m\u00e1s peque\u00f1as, estos micropl\u00e1sticos terminan siendo absorbidos o ingeridos por muchos organismos, aloj\u00e1ndose en sus cuerpos, tejidos[4] y despu\u00e9s de su muerte por intoxicacion, al no poder diferenciar entre si es su alimento marino, incrementandose el problema, entre aves marinas, peces, escualos, mam\u00edferos acu\u00e1ticos, como una ballena varada que muri\u00f3 a causa de la ingesta de pl\u00e1stico. El ciclo completo y movimiento de los micropl\u00e1sticos en el medioambiente aun no se conoce por completo, pero es un tema que actualmente se est\u00e1 investigando.[5] Tambi\u00e9n contin\u00faan siendo investigadas las posibles consecuencias de estos micropl\u00e1sticos que terminan alojados en el cuerpo humano, que han sido encontrados en algunos alimentos provenientes del mar, como la sal, el agua embotellada y la del grifo. \ufffc Microesferas de polietileno en pasta de dientes \ufffc Fibras Micropl\u00e1sticas identificadas en el ambiente marino Clasificaci\u00f3n Fuentes", "pollosince85": "Climate change zombies", "_david_huba_": "Menschen sto\u00dfen Methan aus greta", "hunter_petrovic": "69\ud83d\ude02", "dsblocks_original": "Nice.", "alex_kiedrowski": "Nice", "surellyospina": "nice", "sawyerkairys": "Nice", "jasmin.suga": "nice", "bben_r": "Nice", "fotogra.af": "Tomorrow is #dienstagfordiesel", "andre.ksr69": "69", "denis.777ru": "Bullshit", "tillyashhh": "Nice", "iltitta_": "Nice.", "jonavsn_": "Denn armen Kindern wird die Bildung entnommen", "cp2891": "How can schoolchildren strike?
