As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years of age and typically last for a person's entire life. Yes, that is why her speeches are so, say, special. You might think she is acting out, she isn't. She has a difficulty in nonverbal communication.
