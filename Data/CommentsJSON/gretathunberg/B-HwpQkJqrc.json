Globally, we experience the worst planetary pandemic following Covid-19. The \u201cmandatory quarantine imposed\u201d by governments has forced us to confine ourselves to our homes, in a conscious way: to take care of each other, avoiding the spread of this sad pandemic. Together with a group of citizens and artists who love Culture and Art, it has occurred to us to implement an international \"online\" campaign, symbolically, once the \"World Pandemic\" ends, that the citizens of each country, let us go out to the forests, national parks, squares and streets to embrace the trees as \"love\" towards the planet and life: they represent the new paradigm of \"caring for the ecosystem of all\". We ask you to evaluate the feasibility of your leading, along with thousands, this \"crazy\" and beautiful idea. Darlings Leon Pascal Cheetham. Journalist and Writer.
