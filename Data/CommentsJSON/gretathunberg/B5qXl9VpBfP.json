Most of the instrumentation / manipulation is being done by the media narrative, rather than by the Greta narrative (which does not point for example to secret projects of the geo-engineering elite .... because of being too 'smart'/awake for some things and not for others; as there is a neurosurgeon who does not believe in reincarnation or out-of-body existence until experiences near death; or a person who does not believe in chemical clouds until they get on a dump airplane); who may not 'believe' in certain realities, limiting themselves in their view of the real / major problem).
