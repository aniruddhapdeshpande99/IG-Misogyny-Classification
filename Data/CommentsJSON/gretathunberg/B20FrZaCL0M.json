Hosen wurden mit bunten Borten verl\u00e4ngert. Zum Einkaufen und zur Schule musste ich mehrere Kilometer zu Fu\u00df laufen, transportiert wurden die Eink\u00e4ufe in einem Netz.

Geschenkpapier wurde vorsichtig ge\u00f6ffnet um es wieder zu verwenden. Wir sammelten Altpapier und Flaschen mit der Schule und halfen bei der Kartoffelernte.

I\u2019m not going to insult her, but I am going to point out what she is doing: not one single time through her emotional act did she say one piece of factual evidence. Here\u2019s facts: NASA has stated that \"climate change\" has many factors, including the earth\u2019s tilt. https:// earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Milankovitch/ milankovitch.php \u2014 climate change is also effected by orbital variations. https:// earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Milankovitch/ milankovitch_2.php , https:// earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Milankovitch/ milankovitch_3.php \u2014 the FACTS are climate change narratives not only have trillions of dollars backing them, but also convince people to vote for policies and laws that give the government more control, especially over taxation. In 2014, Antarctica\u2019s sea ice reached RECORD MAXIMUM. It was so thick, a global warming expedition literally got stuck in it (NASA) \u2014 no the ice caps are NOT melting. The sea levels are rising? Also wrong \u2014 Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) reports no rise in sea level. 99% of scientists agree global warming is man made? Also wrong, 31,487 scientists from around the world have signed a petition disagreeing with the climate change narrative (PetitionProject) Al Gore preaches the climate change narrative, but he makes MILLIONS off of it. | wish this girl knew that! \u2014 The Climategate scandal proved that key data involving man\u2014made climate change was manipulated. (Info with direct links from DailyWire) \u2014 Last but not least: Finnish scientists released a studv: \u201cNo Exoerimental hQOR Evidence for the Significant Anthropogenic Climate Change.\" https://arxiv.org/pdf/190100165.pdf \u2014 my final points: I certainly believe in living a cleaner life, and protecting our planet. Do not pollute, pick up your trash, and those who don\u2019t should be punished. With that being said, according to the Global Carbon Budget of 2018, China (208%) and India (155%) are responsible for INCREASED carbon emissions while the US (\u201410%) and Europe (\u201416%) have DECREASED carbon emissions.
