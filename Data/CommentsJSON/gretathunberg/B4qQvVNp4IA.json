We need to start building new homes and communities on the WATERS AROUND THE WORLD that are environmentally friendly. Just like the Netherlands has done, but on a much larger scale. We currently have the chance to save millions of lives, especially with rising sea levels and the reality of climate change. We shouldn't wait for major disasters to happen. We can do something great now to protect lives and future generations by building floating homes and communities on the WATER. Sadly, no one is doing anything to initiate this idea. It should be on the top of our list relating to climate change and rising sea levels. We have the resources and technology to build affordable, solar powered new homes and communities on the water. We been saying this for over 12 years. We need to take the initiative on this idea soon! Sharing our thoughts and ideas on the environment and climate change, and how we can all help each other. Sharing is caring.
