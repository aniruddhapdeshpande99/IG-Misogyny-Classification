This has got to be the most hypocritical thing I\u2019ve seen, Greta literally took transport filled with carbon emissions to say this back in January. The fact that people from the left will listen to this just because she is 17, and tell people who don\u2019t listen to her that they are making a victim out of a child, is despicable. I am 15 myself, and I actually study these things, not from fox, not from the daily wire, but from actual studies from government agencies, and I don\u2019t get over 10 million people listening to me on Instagram. How dare you, Greta, for proposing something that could very well end human civilization, if not send the world into chaos, without being educated on the likely effects of these actions. There would be no more food, electricity, means of transportation, any of that. All of the \u201cclean energy\u201d comes from a factory run by fossil fuels somewhere.
