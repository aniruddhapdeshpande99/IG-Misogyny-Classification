I personally feel myself in a weird in-between. I started my IG account as a fitness/accountability one, and after the death of my mom I gained back whatever weight id lost plus some. It's been an evolution for me to figure out and accept that I don't have to decide to be a fitness chick or a woman who loves her body now...I can just be myself, however I am, and work on overcoming self-loathing and fear. I've struggled through ED and self-mutilation, and struggled to find my voice, but it's honestly been the best and most challenging/authentic thing that's happened since I've gained weight back. It's forced me to embrace my body as it is, and love myself through the apathy and pain that comes with grief. I felt like an imposter trying to promise body positivity, until I realized that I was just speaking from my heart. Anyway, that was long, and I just want to say I really appreciate you. It's good for women like me who have evolved out of a strictly fitness/weight loss mentality and into an acceptance and self-love regardless mentality to see your posts and be reminded what true body positivity is about.", "ana_farrah": "Body positivity is simply someone being happy and more importantly comfortable in their own body regardless of ones size, shape or frame \u263a", "charlenegirl": "\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc", "bodyposipanda\nVerified": "Verified", "love_to_style_uk": "Very true I have very slim clients who still hate their bodies!", "prettyplusme": "I agree with u Arti.
