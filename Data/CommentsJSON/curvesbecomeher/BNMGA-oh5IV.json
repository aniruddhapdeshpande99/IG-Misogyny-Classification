{"becci_sabbath": "I too have damage to my sciatic nerve also back in 2002 it left me being rushed to the hospital in an ambulance it had gotten that bad I couldn't walk or move my lower part of my body with crippling back spasms every few seconds this was all Brought on by an attack that happened to me in 2002 and since them I've been left with severe lower back damage and most days a pain off around 8 to live through basically 'it's fucked' and now it effects the nerves all throughout my body arms, legs, neck, fingers it's also meant I've had to learn ways of living around this condition and doing 'normal' everyday tasks are exhausting but I do my absolute best to do them, some days I wake up and it takes me around an hour just to warm my back up some nights I cry because I'm tied of the pain and how it's effected my life, I haven't had a sciatic relapse since 2004 once again hospital, morpheme, muscle relaxers and total bed rest for 3 months. But I live with the aftermath every day 24/7 it never goes away just the pain level can be different each day i have a very high pain level so I'm so thankful for that !!!! It's so difficult trying to find someone who fully understands how living with chronic pain effects your emotional and physical life it's changed mine a lot and it's extremely hard to get doctors to listen.

I see a lot of ppl saying yoga helps, but I want to chime in that if in a flare up, avoid yoga other than savasana. I've been doing yoga for a decade now with sciatica and it's impossible for me to enjoy anything during it. Yoga is great to keep things open before/after an episode.
