When I was in school (for paramedicine) we were taught that as long as a baby is crying, he/she is okay. It's when they are silent that we need to worry.

Only my mother once when I was in my twenties said something to make me think otherwise: 'you are beautiful when you cry.' At the time I was making some very difficult life decisions and I think anything good she saw in my distress was the will to get through it and out the other side, but I couldn't comprehend beauty in that situation. And my husband in the early days would tell me crying made me less pretty. As if our looks are important when we are in distress!
