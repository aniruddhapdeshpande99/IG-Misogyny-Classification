How incredible sad it is that we hate ourselves and our bodies and it is ENCOURAGED by ridiculous diet culture and misinformation about health and weight. Much love to you.

I have PCOS as well and went through a major weight loss 5 years ago- spurred on by the idea that the more I lost the more chance I'd have of finding someone who'd love me and caused by over-exercising, anorexia and bulimia. Although some might say I was healthier then-I disagree entirely as my mental state was full of depression and self loathing. I still struggle to be ok with my body just as it is-but I am so much better off mentally letting my body do what it can and accepting its limitations.", "srishangeetha": "\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "sritha2": "I feel the reluctancy for photographs, I still hate it and I hate photographers that don't read my no", "allsizebeautiful": "You were beautiful then and even more so now that you wear your true self. \ud83d\ude0a\u2764", "amruta_nargundkar": "It is so wonderful to see how you love and respect yourself \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd17", "lara.k.robinson": "love to you and your whole being.", "liisalouwho": "Thank you for sharing your story!

But now I'm 56 and I'm shaped like my grandma before me, quite plump.... And i hate myself.... I try to think it isn't true but i look in the mirror and i disgust myself.... I'm too old to be doing this! I tend to dress gender fluid... Right now I'm going through a boy stage.... During this stage is when i hate myself....i want so bad to love me again.... Listening to you helps... Seeing this photo of you stops my heart because it's not you with your essence... I don't want to lose my essence.... Why do i hate me?", "punk_flamingo": "I fully understand your mindset then and now! \u2665\ufe0f I\u2019ve been a passenger on the weight rollercoaster and it\u2019s not easy.

I don't know if it's moving to Singapore - but moving here I definitely feel like seeing thin Asian girls everywhere + some comments i have received for not being skinny, has brought some of those toxic dieting thoughts back.
