They talked a little about their own image problems and made a vow of never being dickish towards one another. At the end, one of them came over to me and asked \"but you're ok now, right?

Once whilst holding a ballroom workshop for children, a child called me \u201can ugly back girl\u201d in Spanish, she told an adult that she didn\u2019t want me to teach her.

Unfortunately, he is addicted to nicotine and at the time wasn\u2019t trying to work on alternatives to cigarettes. He is a professional musician and was smoking by himself on a set break in an alley one day and a girl with her mom, probably about 8 years old, said to him, \u201cYou disgust me!\u201d And her mother just smirked at his flabbergasted face. I know this really hurt him because he already feels shame and upset about smoking and feels he doesn\u2019t have the power to change that habit and part of his life... But when he told me the story I was so angry! That mother is teaching her daughter cruelty over compassion and kindness. This isn\u2019t a feminist moment of communication or speaking your mind but just teaching cruelty. He wasn\u2019t smoking on a public road and it wasn\u2019t a reminder to be aware of asthmatics or anything... Anyway, he took this experience and composed a rather great song titled after her words. :) And now we can all discuss it, laugh about it, and start conversations about compassion with addiction and that yes, he made mistakes when he was a teenager to even start smoking but a decade later, that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t deserve kindness and support in trying to quit smoking. It sucks that this is just one of numerous stories. People aren\u2019t empathetic about addiction in general but especially things like alcohol, food, or nicotine...
