About two months ago I walked into my dr\u2019s office to talk with her about my mental health. Not only had I not showered in 3 days, but I was wearing the same yoga pants and sweater I hadn\u2019t changed out of in 3 days. I had taken on clients who needed very clear boundaries communicated and I wasn\u2019t in a mental space to create those boundaries, so every time the multitudes of texts and emails came through from them I only got more anxious. I was in the waiting room, filling out the quick checklist analysis of what level of depression I was feeling when an email popped up and I burst into tears. I had been drinking and eating to excess, gaining 30 lbs, a number on the scale I had only seen during pregnancy. The only reason I didn\u2019t score the highest number on the depression screening was because, while many days I laid in bed thinking I could easily never move my body again, I never wanted to actually be dead and leave my children. I\u2019ve since responded really well to the medication I was prescribed and feel capable and hopeful. It\u2019s been an eye-opening experience, also brought on after a divorce, but took years and a few more heavy events to get to a place where I realized I was not okay and didn\u2019t know how to get okay again. Thank you for speaking out. It was so important to me to start watching videos of people describing how they felt with anxiety and depression and identifying the symptoms that I was feeling as well.
