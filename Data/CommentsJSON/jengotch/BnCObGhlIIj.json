If we know our triggers and avoid them, we can properly manage our emotions and mental state. It is up to us. If we claim depression and anxiety to define us then it becomes part of us and we lose our power to it. We are responsible and we have the power to raise our vibration to a higher state by making the right choices and controlling what goes in and out of every part of our being.
