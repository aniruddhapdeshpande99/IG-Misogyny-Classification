I don\u2019t know you personally and so naturally I feel like I\u2019m not qualified to give advice but I also can\u2019t help but to think about all of the incredibly hard, and (seemingly) unfamiliar work you\u2019ve been doing for what seems like a better part of a year. I\u2019m talking your podcast and now your book. From what I\u2019ve seen from a silly social media app it looks like your book has consumed and uprooted you so much from your daily life, a life/routine in which you\u2019ve worked so hard to sort out so you can feel more balance regularly. You\u2019ve done things maybe you wouldn\u2019t have done if you weren\u2019t all in for the book. I\u2019m not saying those things you\u2019ve done are wrong, or signing up for the book was wrong, I\u2019m just wondering if this is the response your body is having after you worked so long to find a more sustainable 7.8 and then you chose to add these other challenges in that your brain and body don\u2019t know how to handle so you\u2019ve felt a ton of overwhelm? I hope you feel very proud of ALL of the work you\u2019ve done, both for your mental health, and for your career and to advocate for others with mental health hurdles. Maybe this is your brain releasing all of the stress and confusion and overwhelm it\u2019s felt these past months from the challenges you accepted and it\u2019s just now feeling like it can let it out? Ugh this is so long winded, I\u2019m sorry. Maybe try to let your feelings be your feelings. You said you don\u2019t think it\u2019s depression. Maybe you don\u2019t have to do anything but have your cry or your scream in your car because they want to be set free. Set the anger and the sad free and maybe soon you will feel lighter again. Maybe don\u2019t try to fix? Maybe this is your body\u2019s way of \u201cfixing\u201d itself? I\u2019m so sorry for the long winded comment. I wish I could really help! Xoxo enjoy those donuts lady.
