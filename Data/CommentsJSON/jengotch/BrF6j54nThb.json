Last night as I stared up at the night sky begging God not to abandon me I got a serious chill down my back and realized that I might not make it to my 45th birthday, I turn 44 in January. I\u2019m scared that the demons and their havoc that they do on my brain\u2019s chemistry will push me to the edge and I will jump off, or the opportunity to walk in front of a moving vehicle might make the pain and struggle go away or going to sleep and never opening my eyes again will be a permanent cure. So I want to say thank you because even though I know there are so many people with mental illness in the world ; there are fewer people open to share it and talk about it. I\u2019m going Tuesday to get assessed and put back on my meds; I\u2019ve fallen so far down the rabbit hole that I\u2019m trying to claw my way out. But u have given me the courage to see a little light and to take that first step to wanting to live. I don\u2019t want to die, I don\u2019t to feel like my children deserve a better mother and that I\u2019m a screw up. I need to try for them, but mostly for me!\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f I wish you lots of love, you are seriously a DOPE and BRAVE woman!", "elluminated": "Thank you for this!
