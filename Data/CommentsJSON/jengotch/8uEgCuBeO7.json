Not myself. About seven years now (since I was about 40) going through peri-menopause. Had never even heard there was such a thing, then started reading about it and felt like I was reading my life story. Also started talking to my same age friends and asking them what the heck was up with my emotions and my anxiety and my strained marriage and my insomnia and my crankiness, etc. These things had never been my norms. It helped to know I wasn't alone, and that there were physiological things contributing to it all. Man, being a woman is complex. It's been the hardest thing I've walked through and I'm still figuring it all out. Stumbling a lot, pretty exhausted, but I have gotten a lot more vigilant about trying to take care of myself, even in little ways. Many doctors don't even really seem to know much or be able to offer much and it's also just not the most elegant or fun topic to discuss openly with people generally but it's real. The struggle is real, ha! Can someone please come up with a better word for it than menopause or 'the change.' Ugh. Not cute words. Anyway, you are right, our brains are complicated and beautiful.
