Here's what the interwebs had to say about it~ The rabbit represents many things, including abundance, fertility, and overcoming fear. It\u2019s telling you to think things through and look before you leap too. The rabbit reminds us to look within ourselves, to recognize our gifts, and to build upon their strengths. Do you have a strong intuition? Do you listen to it and follow through, or do you hear it and ignore it? As with all spirit animals, each rabbit sighting is also a message of change.
