I found your videos at a time in my life where I had just started going to therapy and was finally ready to open up and learn about sex, but I wanted to learn about it from a psychological perspective. I did this in order to change the narrative in my head from sex being malicious to sex can be healthy and healing even. Not to be too long winded, but your videos were everything and MORE. Thank you Shan, viewing your channel has changed my life in unimaginable and in ways that I once perceived as insurmountable. Even if you aren't sure all the time of this fact, just know that you are ACTIVELY changing lives all the time. I love your style in which you deliver information, because it is a true testament to the depth of your knowledge. Whenever you are able to take complicated psychological terms, theories, and processes and break then down into relatable terms, you know this is your calling, your field, and where you feel most confident.
