I will give the rare perspective from a guys view. I don't have any crushes. I am an older guy who is profoundly disillusioned about women. But in the past it has been a combination of the following: 1. Rejection fear. I have always prided myself on having never been rejected. But it's because I have never allowed myself to be (have never asked). I like having that perfect score. It's never happened...at least not in my adult life. But I did ask a few times in my teens...and was shot down. Once or twice over the phone and once face to face. The few times that I asked anyone on a date as an adult were via the internet/email. And they said yes. If I sense even a slight chance of a rejection...I don't make the move. I think (I know) that I am a better man than the a-holes who women chase...and who dog out women. So I couldn't live with the idea of lesser men easily getting what I can't or what I have to work 10x harder for. Is that pride? Maybe so. 2. More specific rejection fears are due to a). Being a black guy (when the female is of a different ethnicity). I tend to like women who aren't likely to date black guys/men of color...could be due to stereotypes or their families & friends not accepting it. b). Not having enough money (I only earn between 40k & 50k....not much for my education level). Most women will judge a guy negatively for that...even if they aren't heartless golddiggers. 3. Being too old. I allowed my best years to pass without taking any chances or pushing myself to meet more women (the dating ritual is just not a pleasurable task...it's a chore. I get no enjoyment from it whatsoever). Most women of child rearing age aren't interested in a guy my age. 4.
