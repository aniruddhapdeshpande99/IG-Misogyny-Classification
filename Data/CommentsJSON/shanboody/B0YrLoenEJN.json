However, the audio snippet via Audible led me to believe that maybe what I assumed would be a cheeky, possibly sleazy read might actually be something deeper... I am so glad I pressed \u201cpurchase\u201d - this audiobook (expertly voiced by Shannon herself) actually has little to do snagging the man of your dreams and everything to do with engineering the LIFE of your dreams. (That includes a dope romantic partnership). The accompanying self-assessment quizzes are soooooo time consuming. And. Worth. Every. Hour.  This work of art 1.) Empowers you to hold a mirror up to to yourself and examine every inch of you. 2.) Equips you with actionable steps and mindset shifts to engineer a life (and love) you consciously choose and truly adore.  Bonus: these shifts work for every area of your life: romance, family, work, errthang!
