Back then, with no paternity tests, the only way a man could determine if the child was his was matrimony. Today marriage seems a bit archaic because paternity can be scientifically proven. Marriage is a business contract that has dire consequences for the breach thereof. Therefore, if you choose to get married my suggestion would be to choose a mate that is adding to your estate, an asset not a liability. If your partner isn't bringing anything to the table but looks and affection seems to me that you could find that anywhere and marriage in that case is more of a liability. Love should be in the equation of course; However, do not let it blind you to the reality of things. Most of the time we are driven into marriage not by love but alterior motives.", "_nikitka_": "For me, marriage is a dying archaic ritual. It's hard to believe in marriage, because the idea of marriage is forever. But as people, we grow, we change, and sometimes our feelings for others can change as well. Yes, it takes commitment and courage to stay married to someone, but sometimes marriage is viewed as bondage. I myself am divorced, but my partner and I are committed to the idea of being with each other for the rest of our lives.

I can be with someone for the rest of my life and be spiritually married. We could wear rings and call each other hubby and wife or wife and wife or whatever and I\u2019d be okay with that. It wasn\u2019t until an ex-girlfriend told me that to get married as gay women could mean it would be easier to do second parent adoptions and for establishing things for our children. For me, marriage happens long before the actual act. But I do agree that I\u2019d love to call someone my spouse because I want the world to know just how much I truly love that person.

I don\u2019t believe in it, I believe that if I find someone and we are committed to one another we should work to continue that commitment over and over and love each other for who we are.
