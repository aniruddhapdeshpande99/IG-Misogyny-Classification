No one ever told me that lol then my doctor insisted that I quit immediately and suggested the mirena IUD. The reason why I started the pill to begin with is bc I get very bad cramps and had to skip work for the first 2 days every time. Now the iud.. it was the most traumatizing experience of my adulthood. I can\u2019t explain how bad it was. I took strong painkillers before going to the doctor as suggested still had incredible pain when it was put up. The following day I remember waking up and try to get out of bed to take a shower.. I literally crawled to the shower and then passed out from pain. My mom had to come and pick me up from the floor and dry me off and put my pjs on and feed me. I couldn\u2019t move at all. I got it last day of April and got it removed second week of October. All throughout the time I had it I had days where I couldn\u2019t move my legs from pain, I was constantly in bad mood and it took little as nothing to get me upset. I\u2019m very active and I used to run track and now I dance but thru this whole time I couldn\u2019t do any workout activities, even small stuff like walking up stairs could trigger pain that lasted for hrs.
