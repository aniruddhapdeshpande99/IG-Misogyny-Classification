I think you may want to look into the difference between cultural appropriaton and cultural assimilation to get the answer to the question: who benefits. The fact that everybody is allowed to wear white people's culture is because everyone is forced to wear white people's clothing. That's assimilation. Not showing parts of yourself because it will make your life, career etc harder. Many things that are appropriated such as hairstyles, cultural wear etc. would mot be accepted e.g. in the workplace or are banned in schools or the military when people from that culture wear it. This benefits white supremacy. Now, if a white artist wears another culture's heritage or white kids wear it at festivals they are firstly most likely unaware of its origins, and if it went hella mainstream and they got the item from HM, no non-white people benefited from it financially. Finally, if it concerns an artist who wears sth for a performance or video clip, without cultural awareness or proper execution/context, but they make hella money from joining the trend, which poc arent able/allowed to join in on... This is how cultural appropriation benefits white supremacy, by erasing poc history, taking away financial opportunities from poc and making a profit for white people. Your case doesn't include many of these elements, not only are you of the culture you portray, you also know the proper way to contextualize the clothing. + You purchased and promoted a POC owned vendor. Now, I don't think the policing of cultural appropriation is benefitting white supremacy, it is aiming to protect and uplift poc and their cultures. In your case it just seemed like it benefits white supremacy because it was a wrongful accusation. When a white artist wears a bastardized native head dress, or when white girls wear glitter on their forehead without knowing where this custom came from, I don't think this benefits people of colors financial wellbeing or their social status. thank you for coming to my ted talk. \u270c\ud83c\udffe", "hiba310796": "I think some people think you are african american because they didn't watched all of your vids", "delynn": "When I first saw your pictures I did question it.
