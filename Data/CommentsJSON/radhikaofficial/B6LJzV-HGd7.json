Which 3 countries? Ans. Pakistan, Bangladesh & Afghanistan 4. In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law 5. Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can *never* get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro\u2019 the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro\u2019 naturalization rules\u2026.11 years of residence etc. 6. Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case 7. Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No 8. Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution \u2013 Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent \u2013 religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries 9. Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan 10. What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils 11. Doesn\u2019t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans.
