It is a retelling of the Mahabharata Saga from the gendered lens of Draupadi or Panchali as she's called in the book. The author has done an amazing job at sticking to the original epic. One must have heard generally from many, how Draupadi was the reason behind the war. But this intriguing book changed my perspective. The narrative is telling of the life and travails of Draupadi, the woman who was born out of fire, married to five of the fierciest warriors of her time, the Pandavas. Beautifully written and captivating.
