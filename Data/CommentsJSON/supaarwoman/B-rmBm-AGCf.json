{"maryannmoraes": "Hey Supriya. I was lucky to have met you in a train at lower parel haha. You are such a sweetheart. I love you and your posts on Instagram make me laugh always. I love BTS too. And they thought me how to love myself. I have been suffering from pcos thyroid and diabetes too. I get lots of hair all over my body and also used to get teased about it in school. I too hated how I looked. I've gained weight now and my uncle(who's fatter than me) says a lot of mean things. Once I called him to wish him on his birthday and he told me I look like a 40 year old aunty... Looking at you now I'm proud of you because you've always been such a confident person. I never knew you suffered so much and it hurt me to know that. I'm glad you're happy now. And I will keep supporting you always \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "blushstoriesby_jankisunita": "You are an amzing soul \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "geethika_bajaj": "You goo gurll\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\ud83c\udf89", "robingerr": "Thank you for inspiring me too @supaarwoman tons of appreciation yaar\u2764\ufe0f", "stuffednstarved": "We love you! \u2764\ufe0f", "little_strong_dreamer": "You are amazing ...\u2764\ufe0f", "geetha.m_": "@supaarwoman ...You really are a super woman..\ud83d\ude18\ud83e\udd17", "ravya__": "\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728", "wraveler": "\u2764\ufe0fyou are boss girl\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udd25", "selenator_till_end": "@supaarwoman I want to pull yr cheeks n just wanna tell u....that u r doing really well I love the stuff u upload ....", "somecoolhandle": "\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4f", "fateem18": "Absolutely love the person that you are and everything that you do!
