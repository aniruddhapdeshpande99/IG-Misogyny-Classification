I am currently one of the speaker associate at TEDxColumbiaCollegeChicago for spring 2016, If one of our current speakers decline our invitation, I will definitely fight to give you a space as a speaker for our event. I want to provide you that space that cuny couldnt. I will of course reach out to you more formally and not over Instagram. Your words are to amazing to even benefit an institution like that.

I attended a reception last night at the speakers reception I was hoping to see you there but I guessed the time didn't worked. I honestly was so disappointed about the Unprofessionalism they showed before the conference and at the conference the host was so horrible and its not fair the you weren't allowed to speak. My next project is to plan a saloon at Lehman College is something as a liaison I need to do. I would like to invite you at Lehman college to come and speak at the saloon, I'll speak more about it with my colleague, my other team member. Please contact me when you have a chance and see if we can meet up and have a conversation. As a Latino this was really unfair.
