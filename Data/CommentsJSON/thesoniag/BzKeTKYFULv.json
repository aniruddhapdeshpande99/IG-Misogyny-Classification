Though a mom myself, I still can\u2019t imagine the devastating impact of seeing photos from a personal tragedy like this shared in this way. And for all my own horror and rage over such heartbreaking news... of course there is still no way a non immigrant, white, non marginalized (other than for my gender) person such as myself can ever fully comprehend the range of emotions direct relations and community members must feel!! No possible way. My heart goes out to all dealing with the extra rage and heartache and sorrow you and others in your community must be experiencing. As much as I can understand though\u2014I feel this. Working towards better. Best.", "analaurabuendia": "Thank you for speaking out. I\u2019m undocumented and when I saw that I froze..just emotionally blunting cuz it\u2019s overwhelming and traumatic. So thank you for saying what I couldn\u2019t get across.

But that\u2019s the thing even in itself isn\u2019t it...you shouldn\u2019t have to think of it as your family to see the problem with these pictures. People should just know. It\u2019s a perfect example of the depersonalization of POC and foreign POC in our society. All I know is I\u2019m tired of seeing dead children on my timeline. Their stories matter but these pictures are just crude.", "adonag": "It is an interesting conversation to have. Personally, I think this images are what brings people's attention to the issue. When I first got to the US I was very concerned about how little people knew about many issues and situations around the world. Maybe because I grew up in a country that was at internal war, and I was constantly praying to never get desensitized to the value of human lives because we were constantly bombarded with news about bombs, attacks, killings kidnappings... and the list goes on an on. This photo reflects the reality many people live in a daily basis, but people in North America don't seen to understand that others realities can be even worse than dying while crossing the border. So, I am conflicted. As i feel this can educate people and show the reality many are still not seen, I too see and feel your point", "thicccgemini": "I fucking hear you", "shilo_carr": "THANK YOU", "dardarpinks": "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe", "madelines_mantras": "Thank you for saying this.
