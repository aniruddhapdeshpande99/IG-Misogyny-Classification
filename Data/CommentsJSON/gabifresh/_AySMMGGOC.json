She's an 18 year old (beautifully plus sized) young lady and lives with a condition referred to as hydrocephalus (a.k.a. water head). Faith graduated high school last year after doctors told my sister that she would never walk or talk. As she transitions into the next stage of her life, I would like to bless her with some extras to include a few wardrobe additions and a girls gettaway. Faith has a heart of gold, always shows concern for the well being of others and although she has endured multiple surgeries along with some physical and cognitive challenges, her ambition to lead a productive and happy life has not wavered. Life is about creating priceless moments and blessing others along the way. You make the world just a little bit better by sharing pieces of your journey with people from all walks of life each day. I am touched by what many of your followers have posted here. From those who shared 'hearts' to the more elaborate statements, I know that all of us are immensely moved by what you're doing.

When I found you about 4 years ago, I was in a bad relationship with my body. I'd always been curvy but after having two kids I felt depressed about my looks and gave up on the fun and sometimes wild clothes I always loved. I started dressing old because I felt like I had an old lady's body (at 29). This despair was hammered home by the barrage of style images coming at me; because everyone I saw looked so different than me, I felt very outside of the life and joy of expression people with great style have. Until YOU! The first time I saw your picture I just stared at the screen because you looked like me. Seeing you rocking it helped me reconnect with a part of myself I missed. Seriously you brought my love of expression through fashion back to life and helped be gain confidence to be myself. I would see clothes on you and realize that I could wear that too, and it freed me from a perspective of defeat I'd adopted toward my body and the image I project to the world.

For that reason iv missed a lot of school unfortunately. And just recently I've had my 2nd surgery in October and on my way to recovery. But if I was to win this prize. I would spend it on my mother. She has had to take many days off being with me and what I'm going through. And even before that with my sister because she had something similar happened to her.

Letting go of counting myself out before I feel counted out by others. Letting go of the nagging voice in my head that makes me treat myself as an \"other\" because of my body and then overcompensate for this by always making my presence felt. Letting go of feeling the constant need to be the life of the group since I didn't look like the stereotypical beauty queen. Now I am actively pursuing positive energies from the universe around me because I am committing myself to happy, to treating myself well and to TRULY loving myself, listening to my mind, body, heart, and soul.

I know that finding amazing women like yourself (whose fashion sense inspires me to pursue my own styling dreams of bring couture to ALL women) is part of the energy that the universe is sending my way and I thank you darling.

I've always been a lover of \"beautiful things\" and clothes were no exception but all the lovely fashion blogs and runway stills featured beautiful young women who looked nothing like me. That's when I Goggled \"fat girl fashion\" and came across you. The rest is history. You've exemplified beauty inside and out by simply being YOU and while I am still more of a surveyor than a participator in \"beautiful things\" I appreciate and understand that the image you portray outwards can be... SHOULD BE a reflection of the beauty within and that accepting the person I am NOW is healthier and much more beneficial than waiting for the \"perfect me\" (physically, financially, career-wise, etc.) to start enjoying life. So thank you! Thank you for starting your lovely fashion blog and for being an inspirational young lady who continually shows that talent, persistence, hard work, and a dream CAN make \"it\" happen and that being beautiful doesn't end with makeup and hair.

Sometimes they are celebrating me, sometimes they are trying to pull me back down, and sometimes they are looking up to me which is something I could never have fathomed.

I was devastated. Can you imagine, the water kept pouring down vastly and I called 911 frantically in tears. The fire department came and broke in the upstairs apartment where a pipe burst under their sink. The SAME day, the ceiling collapsed where it flooded in my kitchen. The landlord refuses to fix the ceiling (and it had previous water leakage before and he never fixed it) and he said, its better if I move out and find another place that meets my standards. He said he will make repairs when I move out. I always paid my rent on time and he stated that I am a good tenant. However, he also gave me until January 6, 2016 to move out. I have to smell a rotten type egg smell from this water damage and to make it worse, I suffer from allergenic asthma which can trigger breathing problems for me .

Because of you I wore a swimsuit in public for the first time in 10 years. I take more selfies and buy clothes with bright vivid colors and patterns because I've accepted that I don't need to hide my body. I went on a date for the first time in years the other week and for once I felt good enough and deserving of a nice time. You and other bloggers like you are my foundation for this new found confidence. Thank you so much, and I hope you have a wonderful, colorful, holiday season. \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9b", "daniellecords": "How thoughtful!

You just remind me that social media isn't all bad and daily I'm reminded through you both to continue to be my truest self no matter the opinions people will force upon you.

I'm a relatively new follower so I don't know your journey. I saw some really cool looking swimwear on S4A and saw your picture and link. That's pretty bad ass. I love that you worked so hard to be where you are by doing what you love and being unapologetically you. You've inspired many girls to not be ashamed of their size.", "andrewthegirl": "@gabifresh I can't believe you would be so generous, it truly speaks volumes to who you are as a person IN REAL LIFE! I've been checking out your blog for years now and you have inspired me to love myself for who I am, but today you have inspired me to pay it forward! Thank you for reminding us, especially in a season where it's seems people are only concerned about what they get, that giving is the key. \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96", "thezoechien": "Gabi, your blog and insta combine two of my greatest loves: fashion and body positivity.
