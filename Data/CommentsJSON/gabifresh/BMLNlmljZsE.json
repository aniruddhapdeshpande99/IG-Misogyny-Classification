I always thought I was the only one who thought it was rude for people to say horrraayyyy you're losing weight ... unless I publicly announce that I work out etc.. people should really mind their business. I have friends who have lost weight due to an illness etc .. or depresssion .. so to glorify weight loss (especially if it's clear that I'm body positive) it's just BS. I'm like ok \ud83d\ude12..

What I will say for myself is that it gets super frustrating when I finally see a woman of my size or closely representing me and then all of a sudden after notariety she bellows to what I consider the pressures of \"fame\" or maybe its the financial benefits of having access to those weight loss options and then ends up being this woman I can no longer see myself in. Its disheartening for those of us who follow those women. We can all be plus size and healthy but what happens is instead we end up getting skinny and \"healthy\" which changes the views.
