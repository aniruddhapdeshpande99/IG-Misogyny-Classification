I remember during my darkest times , i used to just look into the mirror and smile and dance the jiggly wiggly way, pat my own back, laughed , kissed my mirror image and embraced my self, cried, laughed, and a wave of thrill and gratitude filled me up , and i was reminded that the strength has always been there, it\u2019s just that i didn\u2019t recognise it at that time.
