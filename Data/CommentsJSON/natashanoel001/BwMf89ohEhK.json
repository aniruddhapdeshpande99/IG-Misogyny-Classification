According to u everything is normal even if its a problem . I m following u for quite a long time on Instagram as well as on fb and youtube. I found I thing common in most of ur posts that u hate many things about urself and u consider every problem to be normal. U consider and show urself as \"YOGINI\" but ur mental state as well as ur habits are not even 1% of a true \"YOGINI\" .No dout I like ur coolness and being outspoken, but is it necessary to post everything as to whatever u do . Coming back to this post regarding butt acne, it's not normal at all . It actually shows the internal condition of ur body. If u use western toilet to roop or to pee , this position puts extra pressure on the kidneys as well as on ur pelvic area which can disturb the kaph dosha which further leader to disturbance in pitta and vatta dosha , leading to all sorts of breakouts and acne in any part of the body. I u suffer from constipation or if there is an increase in pitta and vatta doshas in ur body or if u use soap or other chemical products on ur body instead of doing daily abhayanga and bathing with ubtan this problem will happen . The way if we consume something internally shows effect on the outer surface of the body I.e. skin same way any thing applied on body has an internal effect on the body also. If u use soap even if the mildest one , u will suffer from internal dryness of the body . This dryness if happens in intestines u may get acne on ur back especially the waist region , and if it happens in area near anus and rectum u may get butt acne. If there is dryness in ur pelvic area then also but acne can happen . Remember one thing that where ever acne happens , in which ever part of the body, that means that in that area ur kaph dosha has been disturbed which is aggravating ur pita and vatta dosha leading to acne.", "adarsh_vidyarthi": "Got no butt it's ironed flat \ud83d\ude02", "mangeshdongre786": "Nice Butt and Hot too...\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\u2764\ufe0f", "harshikaarora": "Do you raze or wax there?
