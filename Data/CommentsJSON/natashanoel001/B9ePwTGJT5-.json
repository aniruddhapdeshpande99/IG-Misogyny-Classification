We lack moral and sex education in our country and its still not being address by the media or the law makers of our country only kejriwal is making some efforts to improve the education system but what about the rest of india. We need to eradicate illiteracy and poverty from india one step at a time, helping one person makes a difference. When kids will grow up in a healthy environment of equality and harmony they will make a better future but right now our government is not focus on that as it has other issues to handle. Like economy slowdown and propaganda. When a government only talks about its achievement and not it's flaws it weakens the future growth of the community. Like when the gujrat government spend crores of rupees on build walls to hide the poor rather they could have spend that money from the start to build apartments for the people.
