I being a guy, strongly feel that every women is beautiful, every body is sexy. Shaggy boobs, stretch marks, scar tissues, cellulites, they are extremely attractive(and trust me when I say that). One must try to stay healthy but trying to look different and starting to compare one beauty with another, underestimating oneself and in the positive process of trying to be healthier, starting to hate own body, that is quite illogical. Consumerism is partially responsible for this, where they will show you a slim body smooth skin perky boobs and would feed your mind with the thought that- this type of Body is only allowed to be called as sexy, if you are not having similar body, you don't deserve to be called beautiful. Then they would show you the products that can make you look like that. Plz let me and my artworks tell you very strongly. YOU ARE ALREADY BEAUTIFUL. Plz ignore them. You can hit the gym to stay healthy, grow stronger but that doesn't means you can't love yourself now. What are you insecured about? Wear confidence and you will look beautiful in any dress you wear. Keep smiling and you will look pretty always.
