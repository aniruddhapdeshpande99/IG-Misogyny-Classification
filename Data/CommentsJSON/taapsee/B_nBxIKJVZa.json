I want to share a few things with you, I am of marriageable age and ofcourse my parents are looking for a match for me. My parents do tell me often \"beta ladkiyo ko adjust karna padta hai.\" I am into marketing and that requires me to travel quite a lot, recently , my mother asked me to edit out the details of my job in my matrimonial profile, stating that \"travel wagera mention nahi karo baad me dekha jaega\". I am at my home in Delhi in lockdown and I do help my mother in the kitchen, I remember once she pointed out to me \"beta chapati to achi bana leti ho.. Fulke bhi banana seekh lo.. Kuck ladke fulke khate hai.\" Honestly, I have wonderful parents and I am blessed to be priviledged in some ways. However, when in the movie, you say to your mother in law \" kabhi ye nahi socha tha ki house wife banungi..\", \"Mera favourite color kya hai papa?\" I felt that this entire life, making girls independent is fraudulent. When in the movie Tanvi Azmi says to Amrita \"galati meri hai..Vikram ke papa ki hai.. Humne usse nhi bataya ki haath uthana galat hai.. Sandhya ji ki hai ..\" I felt my mother very strongly repeating her all time favourite line \"beta ladkiya zada zubaan chalati hai to ghar toot jaate hai\". I have a lot of other things ushering in my mind right now.. But I would leave it at that and express my gratitude to you for accepting and completing this project, because it is important for our mothers to understand that women must choose their self respect over any relationship and that not necessarily a married women is happy in a disrespectful relationship, just because she has a husband. And most importantly , the child remains happy if the mother is happy. Thank you Taapsee! Keep on doing such projects.
