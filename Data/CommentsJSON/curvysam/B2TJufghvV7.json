To cater for different shapes for example, pears and apple and hourglass, curvy girls with very large busts and girl with small busts. Girls who are taller with long torsos, girls who are shorter. Curvy girls with skinnier legs and those with large thighs and knees and calves. Not to mention then the target (no pun intended) ages. Everyone needs clothes. Young, middle and older. So think about this retailer having to consider all of these and design a range that\u2019s their customers like. In the one store. It would be a very difficult task. I think Target are trying to please us and using influencers is an excellent way to get feedback and to get their product seen. That is a step in the right direction and a positive. My thoughts are they need to think of their market and cater for them with different stories. Be consistent with their sizing blocks would be a good start. Use fabrics with a bit of stretch. And be fashion forward by being inclusive for both plus size and normal size. Design a good basic range but also include an exclusive fashion drop every couple of weeks that is limited, thereby enticing customers to come in store to check out what\u2019s new in.

I wish they would just extend their preview range further and then also extend their other ranges like Danni Minogue Petites and Lily Loves.

Some tops I can get on, most are too tight across the bust but if they extended further sizes it would be perfect. I spend most my money on small Aussie businesses that cater up to my size or overseas retail but it can be pricey, or take time to get an order which is fine but sometimes I would love it try things on before purchase! Or just make an impulse purchase that\u2019s not a huge splurge! (To be honest if many things fit the impulse purchase would be larger as there as so few places I can walk in and shop off the rack) I\u2019ve spent money on Target when their things have fit me and I like them because I hope voting with my dollars and my Instatags helps make a point. I do give them two thumbs up for their shoes though - so many winners in the last 12 months BUT I\u2019m an average size (8) and not super broad so I\u2019m sure, once again, there would be a lot of people missing out.

In the past I have purchased from Target and other similar stores out of desperation, and never loved what I have bought after the initial wear.", "tagenrowe": "I don't shop at target because their plus size range isn't my style and their other ranges (specifically their preview range) don't come in my size. I fit a 20-22 elsewhere but their preview 20s are too small for me.", "littlemissnochill": "Im a pretty straight 16, sometimes a 14 but very hippy and busty. I find target woman fine for my body, but occasionally I will get lost and end up in the 'young' women section and I will need an 18 which is the biggest that range carries or it just wont fit at all. I also find the sizing of their workwear all over the place \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Their plus range is too big and too long for me\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f So I guess yes, I can find things to fit and I do like what I buy, but I dont like the inconsistency and dicking around with sizes.", "jaybeeworld": "Targets plus size range is so ugly, shapeless and daggy!.. Why do plus size get a \u2018range\u2019 anyway?? Why can\u2019t we just have the same regular clothes but in bigger sizes!? Forever New, Ally, cotton on.. Ect", "keenforpastasalad": "I spent over an hour trying clothes on in target for a last minute event. There was no consistency in sizing which meant I had to keep putting my clothes back on and getting another size. All of the \u201clarger\u201d sizes were really tight around my bust and it was a really really shitty experience. I ended up with a really nice skirt and cami, but surprise surprise couldn\u2019t find a jacket that would fit and sit right \ud83d\ude44", "rebelwoutapause": "I find it hit and miss. Have got some great jeans before and a pair of leather look jeans that I\u2019ve almost worn to death because they are so rad.  I also love the fit and shape of most of their shorts but the cuffs are constantly \u2018uncuffing\u2019 (totes a word) and rolling down. Noticed it across a few pairs over a few years. Drives me nutso and it\u2019s a shame because they\u2019re great otherwise. The activewear is also not bad BUT it would great if they stocked more loose tops that weren\u2019t from the \u2018old lady\u2019 section for exercising. Not everyone wants a tight tee, and not everyone who doesn\u2019t is 60! Some non-clingy racer-back singlets and/or stylish off-shoulder longer lightweight loose tees would be a great addition to the activewear range.  I probably only wander in a few times a year, and usually find something I like, but there\u2019s definitely times where I walk the aisles and find nothing appealing.  For relevance: I\u2019m a 43yo mum of four (sz16) and I\u2019m usually after every day wear that is practical while still modern and relevant.", "thenew_nita": "Honestly when I was larger I avoided target as nothing fit, even the plus size was uncomfortable & unflattering. Even know as a 12-14 they are last choice for me", "alexhoneybear": "I love their straight sized clothing however find there\u2019s a huge discrepancy between it and the plus size 16,18 and 20. Visibly plus sized women simply don\u2019t fit them. And their plus size range is well.... bluntly so matronly, daggy and I just don\u2019t buy it. If they want me as a customer, they need to make their sizing and styles much more appealing and fashionable", "lisaf2710": "I used to shop at target but find their plus section boring, very limited and quite basic. The \u201cregular\u201d section whilst go sometimes to a 20 are vastly different and inconsistent with sizing, I realise the 18 plus is a different shape but the measurements should be similar. I\u2019d also like to see more plus activewear naming tanks. Their quality overall is good.", "_jacqueline_troup": "I find Target\u2019s plus size line offensively bad. Exceptionally limited range, rubbish fabrics, off trend in every way. They have the capacity to make beautiful clothes, in the last few months we\u2019ve seen that in their straight range. Just. Make. Those. Bigger. Target- when you exclude plus size women in this way you\u2019re showing what your values really are.", "stanzie.star": "Agree with a lot of the comments. The plus size section tends to be old school frumpy and a 20 in the regular section is definitely not a plus 20. Although their jeans in the curve are pretty good.", "meandmine82": "I do shop at target, I wear a size 16-18 I recently even bought a dress from the danni petite range ... which fit and I was absolutely shocked about!! Their active we\u2019re i lass on tho ... the fit is awful and not made well ... recently I bought a pair of lonesdale tights size 18 and at $40 I found them quite pricey. I wouldn\u2019t have minded at the material felt nice and not gone complete see thru ....", "steph.derooy": "I normally avoid target because I never know what size I\u2019ll be.

I\u2019m generally a size 22 but their 18+ stuff often swamps me and is ridiculously poorly cut. I\u2019m loving some of their preview range and buy a lot of their basics but would love to see Dani Minogues range extended to larger sizes.", "leahjo85": "I don\u2019t shop at target for clothes - haven\u2019t been for years. I just don\u2019t feel like they get the plus size girl. Most of the clothes could probably be used as work clothes but nothing really for weekend wear. The frustrating thing for me is that brands have these materials for there other size ranges - how hard it is to make some in the plus size range. Just makes me angry and even if I do lose weight and get out of the plus size range I wouldn\u2019t shop at Target due to them not being inclusive to the plus size market", "beautifullyfkedup": "I went shopping at Target about a month ago for activewear, specifically A pair of leggings and a couple of tops - there was one style of leggings plain as and not comfy and one type of top to choose from - ALL were black. I walked two aisles over to the \u2018straight sized section\u2019 and was met with multiple legging and top choices in THEIR activewear section \ud83d\ude44 walked out, no plans to ever go back.

If you are after more than a basic work pant or mumu style top then it isn\u2019t the right shop for you. In saying that I have picked up a maxi dress or 2 over the years. It would be nice to see them offer some \u201con trend\u201d fashion in larger sizes.

The rest of their clothing is very dated and tent-esk.", "iamcharlotterebekah": "Lately I haven't shopped at Target because their sizing has gotten smaller and smaller and their versatility and range can be pretty boring actually. Make jumpsuits without such fitted zips or fastening so that curvier women can wear them and feel confident and great.", "emmaharvie": "I love the Preview range, but the sizing is all over the place. In that skirt, I was 2-3 sizes smaller than normal. Some of the pants I could barely get past my knees, even going up a size. It\u2019s like they have sized up smaller patterns rather than design specifically for a curvy body. The discrepancy in sizing makes me not even want to try stuff on.

Secondly black sells so well because we were all taught growing up that black was flattering and \u201cslimming\u201d so that bullshit takes time to get past those old ways of \u201chow to dress\u201d and I don\u2019t shop at target personally because their range for plus size is dull AF, it\u2019s all one dimensional and no fun and is so badly cut for larger body it\u2019s actually a joke.", "angelamrose77": "yep i do. they have definitely come leaps and bounds in the past few years. about 5 years ago was the most awful cheap range there. so im happy they are on the improve", "lauranicole.b_": "Their plus size range is sooo daggy and frumpy \ud83d\ude11 I don\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t just do their \u2018normal size\u2019 range up into the bigger sizes \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f they don\u2019t need to waste time \u2018designing\u2019 different ranges as their core range is actually pretty good \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Fashion is fashion no matter the size we all want to look pretty \ud83d\udc97@targetaus", "marzy_37": "Being a size 24-26 I find they have nothing but basics (under tanks etc) that fits...
