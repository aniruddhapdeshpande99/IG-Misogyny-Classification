I have started shopping in KMart more lately because their plus size range is improving, and part of it is obviously due to them listening to feedback passed on from people like yourself - so thanks for that! There have been some really lovely options lately - loving the linen and cotton ranges, especially as KMart are working to be more environmentally responsible. My frustration? if that's the right word - is around the difference in fabrics and cut between the two ranges (\"normal\" and plus size). I recently bought a gorgeous pair of culottes in a great print, and a fantastic light, summery viscose/cotton fabric. There was a matching top in the 6-20 range, as well as the plus size range. The smaller top was the same fabric, and looked like it would be really flattering on. The larger top was a clingy knit fabric which looked like polyester, and was a sack-like garment that had that weird pleaty bit in the middle of the neckline (why do designers do that??!!) that just makes everyone look bigger and really frumpy. I realise that a lot of cuts and styles that look good on a 6 aren't necessarily going to look good on a different frame, but a little more thought about what works on different body shapes - the fabric and print - would be great.

It makes me so sad to walk past all the fun colours in the smaller sizes only end up with such drab options in the plus size. Also, some good basics would be awesome - singlets, tees, denim... also you babin\u2019 in that dress!", "sally_finlay": "I purchased the best ever dress recently - I get compliments every time I wear it and would have happily paid 3 or 4 times the price. (the babydoll style with the green background and tropical foliage print). I so want it in more prints! They have the top version in 3 or 4 different prints but not the dress.", "lisaf2710": "Would love to see curvy activewear with a high waist roomy long tops and singlets being just over 6ft I want to cover my tummy. Shorts and pants long and not so flary around the thighs and legs!", "alana_f11": "Material that is less prone to pilling is another problem I sometimes find with their clothes, more cotton, some of their tops are often small around the bust. But all that said half my wardrobe is Kmart so they're doing lots right \ud83d\ude02", "thisismeagankerr": "This is stunning on you Sam! I\u2019d love to see more consistency in fit at Kmart - I\u2019ve tried on a few new season pieces and some are an incredible shape and fit. Others are too big in some places while being way too small in other parts! I\u2019d also like to see them extending the sizing on their plus range", "allytolson": "Love!!!!!", "shellsomer": "I agree with the longer sleeve! And sizing consistency is an issue of theirs!! The active range they used to have was amazing would be great for some items in their straight sizes to be included in curve range.", "loz_bailie": "Love it, can't wait to see what they bring to the table!", "littlemoodesigns": "Looove", "fimailer81": "A suggestion - how about remembering that not everyone who is plus size almost 6 foot tall, it would be great if Kmart could look at a curve petite range", "leannezimmermann": "Fabulous to here that on any improvement \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc all things moving forward is a step in the right direction \ud83d\udda4", "sharna_19": "To have the normal clothes range go up to larger sizes. No need to stop at an 18 or 20. Theres some really great styles at the moment we should all be able to wear the same styles. I\u2019ve recently bought a number of tops at Kmart that I love but am already at the largest size, what about people who are larger than I am.", "shade_swim": "Stunning babe \ud83d\udc95", "sophspics": "Decent shorts (not massively flarey ones on legs) and more cotton items please \ud83d\udc4d", "courtycourty": "Please be height inclusive as well! I'm 6ft tall and the only way I get clothes long enough without showing my butt or hoohar is to size up then every where else is baggy!", "chrisduke74": "Definitely 3/4 sleeves or at least elbow length ... I rarely buy tops because their sleeves are too short ...", "womanofstyleandsubstance": "Ooh I love this outfit \ud83d\ude0d", "emtreephotos": "Please make some trendy plus size clothes. Just because I'm curvy doesn't mean I want to dress like a 60 yr old.", "reneesheaphotography": "That is so cute!", "thisisashrose": "Love this look!! That dress looks straight out of a high end store \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c well done @kmartaus", "taniaconroy": "Prettier plus size lingerie is something Kmart lacks in would love to see a range that caters for fuller busts that is sexy.....", "amysheppardpie\nVerified": "Verified", "l_ren987": "Love that outfit \ud83d\ude0d I would love to see some shorts with a bit of extra length. Would also like if they took into account for plus size arms in their longer sleeved items! And lastly, sizing consistency \ud83d\ude42", "what_bec_does": "Review their prices, just because I wear plus size doesn't mean i should have to pay more than an item from their standard range", "becasutton": "Wow that dress! \ud83d\ude0d", "jenna_a_j": "Great news @curvysam", "amyjean89": "I would just love to see the same clothes from the straight sizes .... they do amazing pieces I just want them in an extended size .... \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"}
