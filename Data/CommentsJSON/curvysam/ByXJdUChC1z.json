Get a cash deposit then get them to send a receipt of payment - that way you\u2019ve got their banking details. \u2014 write them a receipt and sign it saying it\u2019s being sold as is, no refunds. Make sure you get prechange over paper work sorted you need a certain slip to sell it (a mechanic needs to look over it) and fill in the change of rego with the buyer so you know it\u2019s been completed.

Give your car a good wash/clean and Take as many photos as you can (20+ for carsales, & Gumtree alow 10 pics) try and order the photos so the viewer feels like they are seeing the car in person ie. outside shots then inside. Write a bit of a story as well, just like you have here and let petiole know what a great car it has been and why your selling. Also if it has been one owner since new/lady driver/non smoker/no pets etc. List the key features & accessories in point form so easy to read/scan info.

They post the price expected as a dealership sale, private sale, and trade in. Get a quote on the trade in option even if you aren't thinking of going that way. At least in the states I've noticed people selling used cars for under the trade in value in ads. Ironically the system here seems set up so that a private sale benefits the new owner and not the seller. The law dictates a 30 day guarantee for cars sold any price over $4500 here. I believe they call it a lemon law. I'm not sure if there's anything like it in Australia.", "eanewby18": "I hate to say goodbye also! I'm still holding on! Good luck selling!", "shanonni": "I actually brought a new car yesterday and just traded my old one. I'll be looking forward to saying goodbye because the new car is all about new starts.

Or if they insist on driving it, go with them and also hold onto their licence as an insurance policy.
