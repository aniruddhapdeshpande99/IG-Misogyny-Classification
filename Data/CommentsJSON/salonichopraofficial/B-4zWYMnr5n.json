I remember coming home after college, I was then, a first semester novice to many many things in life. I\u2019d put on MTV to listen to some music, and then stumbled up on GOT, Isha was the first character I saw and it instantly became the most relatable one. I was Isha in ways, and wanted to be rave hehe. At a time when people still pretended that oh watching hindi shows is lame, I always felt that no matter what the language as long as the content is a 100, the show is worth the watch. GOT taught me things I needed at that time, it wasn\u2019t such a good time personally. Cut to a while later, I started using Instagram, I looked for you here and when I saw redheadwayfarer, I was like oh that\u2019s not her. But then this account of yours had me the minute I saw the content you were putting out. So bold, fearless. Slowly you grew, on me and on the writer in me too. I have not only been inspired as a fellow woman but also as a person who has abundant love for writing. You\u2019re an inspiration. On so many grounds. So fearless! My take away from you, will always be fearlessness. It\u2019s a quality you hand craft with love, in every post of yours. I said above I was Isha in ways, but now I\u2019m redheadwayfarer in soul. @salonichopraofficial thank you. \ud83d\udc93This is my real name, but it needs modification, to make sure my mom who has bred me, is honoured.\u2764\ufe0f", "dilipkatkar007": "Hotiiee\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udca5", "moonmishra2709": "I don\u2019t know why @salonichopraofficial but i have the ik jindadi meri sau khwahishan song running through my head reading your post.
