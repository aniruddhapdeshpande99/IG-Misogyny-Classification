Most of the world's population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight. 41 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese in 2016. Over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5-19 were overweight or obese in 2016. In India More than 1 million cases ( malnutrition) per year \u201cnot including your so called hot girls \u201c and for the matter of fact unhealthy or fat women make more fun of skinny women who have worked so hard to achieve that figure .

I mean sure, being skinny has been worshipped on TV for forever but in real life, it ain\u2019t fun. Like, I wanna gain some fucking weight. I think being thick and big is the new trend now, at least with all the big clothing brands and celebrities (which is great) but I wish someone would just hear out the skinny girls and not just brush them off by saying \u201cthey\u2019re blessed that they don\u2019t gain weight\u201d. During my student days I\u2019ve heard countless number of people in school and then in uni telling me that I\u2019m flat chested, mummy khana nahi deti Kya? Road roller and to top it all off, one of my friends(tall and pear shaped) and I went on an interview at a very known hotel during summer vacations just to kill some time and have fun working together for the first time. I was told I\u2019d be paid less by the HR guy cause I\u2019m less presentable because of how skinny I am. Thank god I didn\u2019t NEED that job but imagine someone who did.
