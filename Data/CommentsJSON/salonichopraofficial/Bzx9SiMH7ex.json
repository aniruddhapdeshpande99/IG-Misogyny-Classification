I just can't express my happiness and my excitement. So little something about the username and the goals of this page: We all filter out our thoughts and feelings so that other people don't judge us. We've lived in a fear bubble and have always thought about what will people say? Or what will they think about me? So I created this page because since very long time, I've felt the need to always be surrounded near a space which can be safe and positive. A place where anyone can share their stories, their desires, their fears and their insecurities, or anything that is otherwise considered as \"taboo\", without fearing that you'll be judged.

Can't a women now even choose what she wants to speak about I wouldn't be a feminist if it was all about equalising men and women but because it is also about equalising women covering herself fully to a girl flaunting her body the way she wants... Blaming a girl for rape is like blaming a knife for a murder , know the knife never told u to murder u used it the wrong way that makes u a fucking murderer... U know I have realised one thing if at all I become someone I will become maybe in some other continent it hurts seeing women trolled like this tbh a Vitoria secret model also never gets trolled this way atleast not with rape threats... The very fact women don't get to enter some temples n mosques n the fact that they were burnt alive is a reason why feminism is definitely necessary", "shaaaayarr": "Fake feminist fake followers \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f", "adorable_aish1": "@viiidhyy FEMISNISM means equality to every gender. Many feminists believe that freeing their bodies includes being able to show body parts that have been censored by society for centuries. On the opposing side, some feminists, again, believe that women exposing their bodies only feed into the objectification and sexuality imposed on us by men. So, which is it? Can a female be a feminist and show off her body as she pleases, or should she cover up to avoid being sexualized by men? The simple answer I would like to give here is that women should have the right to do whatever the hell they want without neither men or other women having a say. The point is not to simply walk around naked all the time, it is to have the choice to be able to love and show one\u2019s body without having to worry about the people who say, \u201cyou need to cover up\u201d. Women are fighting for the right to cover up, but that should not mean that women should be restricted on what they show. Men should most definitely not have a say regarding what a woman chooses to do with her body because he does not own her- that is what feminism fights against. The bigger issue here is that it is other women, even worse feminists, who are doing the \u201cslut-shaming\u201d that feminists are supposed to be against in the first place. \u201cFree the Nipple\u201d was supposed to be a movement where women fought to stop having breasts sexualized, because they are not a sexual organ, and they wanted to have equal rights to their own! So, I would say screw the male gaze, and screw those who think women who are not completely covered are \u201cimmoral\u201d and \u201cnot decent\u201d, women as a whole need to acknowledge that we own our own body, not each other\u2019s, and we need to stop making decisions based off men, when we are the ones who will actually be affected.", "rupali_mulik_baraskar": "We need more of you & @rahulb90 .
