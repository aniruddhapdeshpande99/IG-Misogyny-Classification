Dear, it's not for the show off girls wear shorts, it's neither for anyone's attraction, she is raped for that is a viewpoint of people like you!! She's beautiful when she's naked and she's beautiful also when she wears full clothes!! 'Logo' ke dimaag nange hote h toh bardaash ni hota apna desperation. @redheadwayfarer I'm a victim of 'the incident' too! I've always kept it hidden from my parents, but I've fought, I'm still fighting for myself, I feel strong every when I count the number of days I've lived after what ruined the 'girl' inside me! But still, I feel strong when I carry my cleavage well in front of all those assholes who desperately wish to fuck, I feel proud for every lady who roams around with cleavage and bum shorts, she is beautiful, isn't she? She's strong , much stronger to face all those who disrespect her, she knows what's happening inside their mind, but she's walking free with her beautiful body and most beautiful soul .

You destroy a girl and her life. I always believe that men should respect women. Be it your mother, sister, wife, friend, girlfriend or even a stranger. That proves you are a man. Rape just proves you are an animal. Our laws should be made stronger. People if proven guilty of rape or sexual abuse should be given the maximum punishment according to the severity of the crime. If the girl is killed, hang these guys without a delay. In case of sexual abuse, make these guys impotent surgically. The media has a role to play and that is by not sensationalising this to such an extent that they draw unwanted attention into this girl and her family.
