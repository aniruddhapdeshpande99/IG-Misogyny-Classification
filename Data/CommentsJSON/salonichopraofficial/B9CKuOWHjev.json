I followed you because I loved you on girls on the top and you're Instagram didn't feel like you where trying to have a small talk rather start a dialogue about something bigger and loved reading what you had to say and I felt hey I feel the same I'm not wrong I'm between wrong people and I try my best to show them the right. Then I moved to Mumbai grew into this young woman of unapologetic thoughts and can proudly say when I first moved here I couldn't call a sexist college friend but now I am not even scared to call my professor on her casual sexism . I don't say you were the reason I'm strong I'm the Reason I'm strong and this person right now but you, malala ,lizzo, my past , the people who wronged me , the people who correct me and the people who support me and most importantly ME and the self acceptance helped me become who I'm today. But waking up and seeing to a picture of yours talking about body positivity and acceptance is way better than waking up to a post talking about how a tea will make me thin. So on my journey of self acceptance and self love you have had made a contribution as well just like so many amazing women in my life and world. And thanks for not giving up on what you believe in because I won't either . I don't completely love myself yet but I don't hate myself either.
