But certain things in this piece of writing regarding why we women aren't allowed to visit temples or cook our food is for the concern our elders show on us. My granny makes me do these stuff like not going to temples and makes me sit at a single place at home during the first three days of my periods every month. It is solely because she believes what her elders have taught her that 'a woman is required to rest for those days because of the impulse of amount of pain what she witnesses' and not because of the orthodox narrow mindset. The way our elders impose these onto us becomes important. Some ill-treat women like how you said and on the other hand someone like my granny 'takes care of me' . About entering temples, the reason is temples are built at places where there is concentration of positive energy which is directed normally (perpendicular with respect to the Earth) upwards and during our periods, the energy is our body is directed downwards. During menstruation, Vata is the predominant dosha. Apana vayu, one of the elemental air functions of the Vata Dosha, is responsible for the downward flow of menstruation. Therefore, any activity that interferes with this necessary downward flow of energy during menstruation should be avoided. During menstruation, women are more likely to absorb other energies in their environment. We tend to witness more cramps and intense pain because of this. This forms the basis of most of the cultural practices around menstruation in India. So this is the prime reason behind it. It all depends on how women are made to understand this. Some people have a very bad sense of treating us and that is the cause for such thoughts arising in us. I completely agree to you but the reason is only this as to why they don't allow us. It is for our own good. Just remind yourself to ask 'why' to them. \ud83d\ude0a", "glamourandritz": "You are amazing", "pranithahaha": "Holy fuck", "swati_1401": "This is beyond amazing.
