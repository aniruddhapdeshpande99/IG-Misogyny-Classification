Sometimes even when I've heard all the factors or reasons behind this horrible pandemic, I still don't understand. How? Just how? I do know how. I just can't process it though. I'm too exhausted. I hate how rape has become normalized that people can go on with their lives despite the shit that's going down. And tomorrow? I might just do the same. Be in denial. But tonight, I'm crying. For her and everyone who's been hurt. I didn't like this post because I can't. It's not something I can double tap for a love icon to appear. Because this is vile. Disgusting. Repulsive.
