It's okay to be a mess inside. It's okay to fall apart every now and then. It's okay to have a headache and a migraine because you've been yelling at those you love and hate. You don't have to know everything. It's okay for us to just let things be sometimes. It's okay for us to feel stupid and then realize that not knowing something doesn't make us dumb. What makes any of us a dumbass is if we bring each other down by treating someone harshly because someone didn't know something. It's okay to make mistakes and not know what the hell are we even doing with our lives. It's okay to be clueless about our future because we are and yet still hold onto the hope that we'll all meet each other again, draw weird shapes on each others' backs and jump on each other and hug each other and laugh until our stomachs hurt. It's okay to feel as if nothing we ever do will even matter. It's also okay if you're suddenly brimming with enthusiasm for doing new things and you don't understand what to do with this new-found motivation. It's okay to not completely grasp the source of this constant unpleasantness, darkness that we feel inside us sometimes. It's okay to not know why we're lashing out more often than we used to. Because ultimately deep down, we all do know. It isn't just the lockdown. We're all a bit exhausted from tending to the wounds in our hearts everyday. Soooo let's just focus on small victories everyday. I deeply apologize if I haven't been more conversant with some of you because I haven't been doing so well lately.
