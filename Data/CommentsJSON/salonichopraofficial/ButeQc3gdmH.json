As far as it is feasible, it is advisable to allow children, both boys and girls, to play in the nude, so that they become totally acquainted with each other\u2019s bodies. Then, later, there will be no necessity for them to snuggle up to each other in the streets. There will be no need to print nude pictures in books. They will be so familiar with each other\u2019s bodies, that no kind of perverted attraction will be possible in the future. But the way of the world is just the opposite. The people who have covered and concealed the body have unwittingly created so great an attraction for it that, although it has overtaken our minds, we still haven\u2019t felt the full impact. But the disease is already there, and it is increasing. The existence of the disease can be observed in the bulk of obscene literature now being published. Sex is natural, but sexuality is the product of anti-sex teachings. If these teachings are followed, if the advice given in these unscientific sermons is taken, the soul of man will be totally filled with sexuality. If man understands sex properly, he can rise above it. He should rise above it; it is necessary that he rises above it. All our efforts to date have borne wrong results because we have not befriended sex but have declared war on it; we have used suppression and lack of understanding as ways of dealing with sex problems. The deeper a man\u2019s understanding, the higher he can rise above sex; the less his understanding, the greater his attempts to suppress sex will be.

What you are doing just amounts to stupidity/cheap publicity and nothing else cuz it's not bringing any change in the society all that your followers are doing is praising you here but while they are leading their lives in their respective societies they are aadhering to the rules prescribed by the society so your objective of bringing in a change for women betterment ( if I'm not mistaken) is not achieved.

For the ones worried about her not focusing on the entire realm of feminist issues and just on the basic right to be howsoever she wants to be clothed or not ; feminism encompasses a lot of issues none more important or less important than others but all seeking a core belief an equality of the sexes on all levels and that includes the use of their body as well however a person wants. For those wondering why aren't men allowed to roam with their dicks out, do tell me why is it that dicks out usually connotes a sense of fear, and male superiority first and then a body part. It's when you negate that fear then we could all be comfortable with men roaming around naked.

What they did, they made a statue of fucking 3400 Crores the money of tax payers, totally unnecessary, quite not useful when you have people dying of hunger, kids not getting basic education, health, opportunities to craft themselves. Now the point being undoubtedly we didn't require that but people compare it with other countries where they do stuff like this, man they are developed, they already have basic facilities, not thousands of people die of hunger there, nor their judiciary is too weak to punish the person in Power or Corrupt. Same point is with you, you are influencing girls in India (majorly) if they will start thinking like that now onwards, how will the really oppressed women will get opportunities to come forward, to fight, to get their rights while the majority is roaming topless, ignoring these facts. See the thing is in India the needs the priorities are quite different from the countries you compare to, first we need to give the girls best education so that they can decide on their own what the fuck they to do not getting influenced by others, secondly they need better sanitation, they need to be acknowledged abt sanitary pads, menstrual cups that can really change their life, 88% of girls in India don't have access to pads, many are dieing due to unhygienic use of cloth for it. Mr.Arunachalam Muruganantham(a MAN ) is fighting to provide and improve the pad distribution in India among the girls unable to access it.

The choice of clothes is a will and that is irrelevant of gender. Equality is a different thing. As far men and women are considered there can never be equality between the two. The sun and the moon cannot fight for equality so is the night and the day. Each and everything has it\u2019s own importance under the sun which is irreplaceable by any other. When you are looking for equality with men, you are actually killing the beautiful feminine within you. In today\u2019s world, brain is the king and hence there is no limitation for a person of what he/she can achieve in life. I agree there has been a grave issue of oppression against women based upon their gender and that has to be fought fiercely and slowly we are improving as a society. So equality is in terms of equal opportunities. Rest, a man and woman can never be equal. If they would it shall disturb the equilibrium. The universe functions on equilibrium. If we move a planet by 1 mm from its axis, the equilibrium of the entire solar system might be disturbed and the earth may perish. So , there can never be equality in two beings.
