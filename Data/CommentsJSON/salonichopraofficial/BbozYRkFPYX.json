Is it our fault if you men get aroused by watching us naked? I mean there are hell lot of men who do naked photoshoots, clearly we don't get aroused by them and that doesn't make us abnormal, it just means that we are not cheap minded like you or we are lesbian! Yes homosexuality is normal! It's someone's sexual preference and the way they are! You moron!
