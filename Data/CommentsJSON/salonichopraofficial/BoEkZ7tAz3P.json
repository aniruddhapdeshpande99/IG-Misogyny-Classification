I myself knew how to dress up or down according to the occasion but my choices were still controlled. I used to dress my best every single day but he wld still want my nail paint to be perfect always. After marriage, I was forced to go to family gatherings heavily loaded with Jewellery and traditional clothes even when I wanted to wear minimal and still manage to look beautiful! They would use me as a bait to up their social status in the society which they themselves degraded. I used to feel like I am just a thing being used and would be thrown away if I do not carry my life on their terms! My opinions and values were never heard or important to them. They wld just pretend that they are just the perfect family for me but from the inside they were never honest with me. And that is exactly what happened.. after sometime when I realised that I am not bng taken as a daughter-in-law in the true n correct sense but just being used or flaunted with wrong intentions ,I started to question things and laying out my opinions and wants more strongly and as a result they got intimidated and wanted me out of the house after that. I was asked to not take up a job bcz my partner chose to remain unemployed and his male ego wld be hurt if I start earning and going out. My mother in law slid all of these brain-washing through my mind v subtly and sweetly without even letting me guage her wrong intentions behind that! Why cldnt she ask her son to take up something ..a job,some business to earn a living rather than pulling me down! Why cldnt she support me when I used to tell him to do something and make a name, a living and I would promise to be by his side always. Why cldnt she do her mother duties correct rather than doing her mother in law duties wrong. He used to lie to me about his work (when there was nothing actually) and they would be giving him ideas how to keep me fooled and how it was fine if he did not work at all.", "hoax__slayer": "Being an Engineering guy Never seen a Guy telling a girl to dress up \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02 They themselves are so concerned about the dresses, I have seen girls coming in fest during winters in one pieces and short dresses and be shivering for the rest of of the time, One often sees Bollywood actress wearing dresses they are least comfortable in to events and launches just to grab some lime light.
