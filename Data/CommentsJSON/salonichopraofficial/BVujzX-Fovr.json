Showing off your naked body doesn't bring the changes in society. If it is so many women in rural areas are getting raped even if they are fully draped in saree. And women are getting raped in metro cities like Delhi even if they are wearing short clothes. It's the men's mentality that should be changed . Not how people dress. The society won't change by encouraging nudity by free the nipple campaigns. It is the men's mentality that should change . They should control their pervert thoughts when they see a women no matter how she dresses. Again yes a girl can wear what she wants but there's a limit when you are in a society.

So, what i think is we have controlled them a lot but didn't get anything good out of it and now we should start controlling our men our boys.
