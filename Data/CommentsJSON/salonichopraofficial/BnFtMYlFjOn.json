I believe that we are as equal to men in brains and capacity and choice/decision making so one doesn\u2019t need extra privileges since we are capable of fighting them on their turf and winning without reservations. I also feel we make right or wrong choices with our men. I have had terrific men in my life. I chose not to marry any one of them. I am a lawyer in the Supreme Court of India, I earn well and I love my independence. But more than that, the men I chose knew right from the beginning there will be no compromises on my values for their sake. They never even suggested for me to change my religion or my profession. And if and when men stared at me for clothes that I wore, I confronted them back instead of writing long posts because we have to change things at the ground level and take action there and not on social media. I have seen enough men who are victims of abuse and false charges to categorise them all as bad. There will always be two sides to every coin. But I don\u2019t believe that unless women show themselves to be victims always, they will not be successful.
