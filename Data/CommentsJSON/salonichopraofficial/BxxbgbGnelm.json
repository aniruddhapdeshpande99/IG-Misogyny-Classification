It's like quick sand, the more you try to get out of it the more you go deeper. The very thought that \" i want to be happy\" is a depressing statement. But human will is powerful and it has the ability to make a person whoever they want to be, it's just that not everyone is blessed with that ability. There you need the support of others but people dont have that kind of patience to wait for the person to come out of their zone. My only request to people is to not abandon people even if they are pushing you away, their sadness is not what they willing indulge into. Be there for them. They want you to be there even in their denial. Dont say that \"we left because you asked us to leave\". No. You're giving them more reasons to believe that you aren't gonna be there in the hour of need. Be more present towards the feelings of your dear ones.
