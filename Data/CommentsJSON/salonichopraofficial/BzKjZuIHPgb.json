Almost all our reservations for our bodies stem from society's idea of how women's bodies should be. The reason we hate our legs, stomach or arms is because they don't fit the society's ideal and something that doesn't fit that ideal isn't acceptable. Beauty has always been a social construct but having said that, I also face difficulty detaching myself from that construct. If someone compliments me for some feature, I naturally feel happy about it but at the same time my self concept becomes increasingly dependent on outside forces, particularly on society's ideas of beauty, all male driven. There were parts in my body too that I didn't particularly like but have come to love them eventually except for my shoulders which have scars owing to an injury. I struggle everyday, like any other woman, trying to teach myself some self-love. In a society, where a woman's appearance is still the most important aspect of her being, practicing self love and acceptance is not easy.
