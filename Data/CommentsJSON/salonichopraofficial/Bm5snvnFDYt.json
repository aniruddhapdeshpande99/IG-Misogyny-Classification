The body of the penis is made up of three columns of tissue: two corpora cavernosa on the dorsal side and corpus spongiosumbetween them on the ventral side. The human male urethra passes through the prostate gland, where it is joined by the ejaculatory duct, and then through the penis. The urethra traverses the corpus spongiosum, and its opening, the meatus (/mi\u02d0\u02c8e\u026at\u0259s/), lies on the tip of the glans penis.
