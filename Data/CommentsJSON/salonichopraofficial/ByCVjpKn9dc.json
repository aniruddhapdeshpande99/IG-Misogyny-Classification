Sex is not just the main agenda of a relationship, but it is one of the important factors too. Just like a guy gets satisfied, a girl should be too. She is not here to please the guy, AND VICE VERSA. If girls are so ashamed to talk about it, then really can't blame the guy who sleeps totally satisfied and doesn't care. Why so much toxicity and negativity in the comments section? That too, from the girls as well? What's the fuss about discussing about sex. She isn't describing HOW TO HAVE SEX guys! True that, feminism doesn't ONLY means sexual desires of women and talking about being comfortable in their own skin, but topics like this, are ALSO one of the parts of feminism, and needs to be talked. Why are some of the people making it a taboo? We belong to that nation where we top in the population criteria (cheers, lol), then why to feel so much ashamed?
