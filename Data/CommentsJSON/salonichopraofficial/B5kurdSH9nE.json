What i believe is that it is better to have community meetings and educate people rather than writing these articles because these article tend to be abstract and have no affect on the general media. All we do by posting articles like this is blow things out of proportion for the victim because a rape victim would certainly not want publicity and would rather have the matter under covers. Its better if we keep this opinions to ourselves and really take action because to put it bluntly the writer of the article has just wasted their time and the only thing they have achieved is a few number of likes on a social platform and not really achieved what they have set out to achieve.
