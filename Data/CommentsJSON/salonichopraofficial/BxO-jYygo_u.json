And also I am unable to understand that how is feminism related to it. In one of your beach photograph in Barcelona you are walking topless with a man by your side also walking topless, I just want to ask you to ask yourself that why are you so conscious about female rights of showing chest, men show chest but they don't bother to advertise it. You also do it and don't bother about the comments and if you do please make your profile private. Because in private profile there are only those people who you know and they will not post negative comments .

If I'm raped and I'm asked to smile and ignore the egrosive behaviour that happened with me - I'll smash their faces and stand up for what happened !
