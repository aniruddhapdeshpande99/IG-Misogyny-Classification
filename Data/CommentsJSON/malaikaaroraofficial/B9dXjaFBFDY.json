You have not fully recovered from a very long term marriage. Regardless of what you may feel now by way of freedom or a sense of release. You have not recovered yet. Equally many marriages, particularly long term ones which fail, witnesses, many extremely poor choices to start dating immediately or to go on a sexual intercourse freedom run. All seriously detrimental to the soul and psychological self. Example; anyone in a long term marriage or relat\u00edonship and experience it falling apart, needs to constructively mourn and go through a process of introspection and reflection positively. The principle of perhaps applying 3 months to each year of the falling marriage or relationship will facilitate deep healing on all levels and sometimes It could take longer but never less. Dating 2 years after a long term relationship is most definitely rebound and is bound to encounter emotional and psychological complications sooner or later, but can be overcome depending on the new partner or love interests and the person who was in the long term relationship. It still represents toxicity and if can be avoided, it's best.
