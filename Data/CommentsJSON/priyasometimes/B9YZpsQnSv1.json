Two things that are heavily assaulted during holi are Women and cameras. That day when i came home i felt so terrible, spoke to my friend and asked her is it a crime for women to want to be photographers and do street photography. Was doing my job. Would mention i did push the assaulter hard but i was worried that my camera would be damaged if i did more....
