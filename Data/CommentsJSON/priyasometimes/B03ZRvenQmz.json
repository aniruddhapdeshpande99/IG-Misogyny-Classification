It seems normal for you to allow separatists and fear mongering politicians in the valley to continue attacking India's sovereignty and integrity! Horrendous approach, I must say. This is quite alarming, to see pro Pakistani stance coming from you. Now let me tell you something, I'm not affiliated to BJP or any other political institution, but I sure do support the abrogation of article 370 and 35 A and will continue to, because as an Indian, national security comes foremost for me. Does the same logic applies for you? I will continue to glorify my armed forces because I owe my life, my security and stability to them. The Indian Armed forces are as much as responsible to the Kashmiris as they are to any other Indian citizen, and it's only because of them that Kashmir, even though 3 days have passed since this despicable act has been scrapped down, not one separatist, fear mongerers or Pakistan induced terrorism has been successful in causing instability in the valley. Apparently, human rights violation is only an issue when it concerns minorities,eh? Why do you \"liberals\" keep mum when asked to comment on the exodus of hundreds of Sikhs and Kashmiri Pandits? An attempt to disintegrate and fuel communal hatred amongst Indians? Well, let me tell you something, doesn't matter how hard, people like you, people like Kunal Kamra, Kanhaiya Kumar and that guy in blue t shirt who demanded an Azad Kashmir in JNU yesterday try, Hindus and Muslims will continue living together in peace and harmony, just the way that it's supposed to be.
