{"courtenay.mc": "@lyndacarg I seriously can't believe what I was reading. Firstly, your comment is utter shit. You are telling her she shouldn't be a teacher because she has an accent and yet you have no idea how to speak English! Your comment is horrendous and I feel sorry for you that you feel that it is ok to be a racist scum bag. @omgpriyamalik speaks excellent English and she could probably teach you a thing or two. You are a prime example of what is wrong with the human race today! Priya and her husband are totally cute and I have a feeling that your comment will be laughed at and then forgotten about very quickly.
