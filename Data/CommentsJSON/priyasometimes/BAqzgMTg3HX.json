I am a teacher myself and I tell my pupils to be unabashedly themselves. When you entered the big boss house I felt Finally someone genuine and daring is going to breathe under the roof of Bigg boss season 9. What was disappointing is that you proved to be a contradiction of everything you stated yourself to be. You corrected Gissele for using the word Dyslexic so casually and you used Racism and Feminism and Sexist and Band wagon and all these SERIOUS ISSUES which people Actually face in their day to day lives. I now give my pupils your example. I tell them #priyamalik is the perfect example of forgetting self respect only to gain attention. And I ask them to never try to be like that.
