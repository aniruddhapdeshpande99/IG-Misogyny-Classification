While some might not wish to put up with the catcalls, I think the actual reason is that women know deep down that their breasts have unique value. No, they\u2019re not all looking to monetize that value, but almost all of them are looking to experience it on their own terms and to share their naked body with the people they choose to.", "prashastishah11": "@time_traveler__ What can we do about people dying?

Just making a comment that global warming is a leading problem isn't gonna do anything about that issue! I have taken certain steps to prevent global warming, which means I'm pretty concerned about it too, but again, comparing this to a RIGHT a person is supposed to have makes your argument completely irrelevant! She is making use of the advantage that she is a celebrity and is trying to influence as many people as she can to let a woman be what she wants to and you're the kind of people that are creating problems! Plus, when you're in a family gathering do you talk about global warming? Or have you not seen enough situations where the girl is being judged about something she is wearing?
