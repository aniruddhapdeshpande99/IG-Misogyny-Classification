In some remote parts of the world men and women don't cover upper bodies, hence their brains are not attuned to perceiving nipples as sexual objects but merely a body part. In other parts of the world such as Indian sub-continent where I grew up, women wear loose trousers called shalwar. Seeing a woman wear leggings or a skirt would generate peak sexual activity in brain for someone not used to it. Revealing a certain body part is relative to how the brain of audience is trained to interpret and receive sexual signals. It would be intelligent to choose the attire in accordance to the signal one wants to send for the audience around. A free nipple wouldn't send a sexual signal in an Amazonian colony, bare legs wouldn't send a signal in most western cultures, collar bone wouldn't send a signal in Mumbai and Lahore, while the sight of a bare ankle or nicely styled hair in Kabul may provoke unintended emotions.
